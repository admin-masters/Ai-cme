  "key_facts": [
    "A suspected case involves fever for 3\u20135 days in a typhoid-endemic area with no clear focus and symptoms like hepatosplenomegaly or gastrointestinal issues.",
    "A confirmed case requires laboratory isolation of *Salmonella* (commonly from blood culture).",
    "Mild illness includes stable vitals, good oral intake, and no significant dehydration, while severe illness involves toxemia, altered mental status, or gastrointestinal complications.",
    "Outpatient management is suitable only if the child can tolerate oral antibiotics, with follow-up in 24\u201348 hours and clear return precautions.",
    "Hospital admission is advised for infants, children with toxic appearance, neurological symptoms, or suspected perforation.",
    "Empiric antibiotics should be initiated after cultures are drawn, alongside supportive care like fluids, antipyretics, and close monitoring."
