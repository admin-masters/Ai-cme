    "Outpatient treatment with cefixime or azithromycin is reasonable for stable patients without danger signs, with follow-up in 48 hours.",
    "Severe disease (e.g., lethargy, delayed capillary refill, abdominal distension) requires parenteral ceftriaxone, aggressive fluids, and close monitoring.",
    "High-dose dexamethasone is recommended if shock or encephalopathy is present.",
    "Persistent fever on day 6 of oral cefixime warrants reassessment, including adherence, dosing, and alternative diagnoses like malaria or dengue.",
    "Vaccinated individuals can still develop enteric fever; cultures are essential to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment."
