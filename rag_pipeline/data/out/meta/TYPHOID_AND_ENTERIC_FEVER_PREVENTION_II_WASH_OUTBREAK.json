    "Understand the role of WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) in preventing typhoid and enteric fever.",
    "Learn the steps for outbreak response, including notification, investigation, and control measures.",

  "key_facts": [
    "Enteric fever prevention relies on interrupting fecal\u2013oral transmission through WASH measures like boiling water and handwashing.",
    "Outbreak response includes notifying public health authorities, testing water sources, and chlorinating supplies.",
    "Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for contacts is discouraged to prevent resistance.",
    "Targeted stool testing and treatment of adult carriers, especially food handlers, is critical for outbreak control.",
    "Reactive TCV campaigns can reduce transmission during outbreaks when feasible.",
    "Evidence-based supportive care measures are essential"
