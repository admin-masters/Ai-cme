  "learning_objectives": [
    "Understand the age-specific clinical presentations of typhoid and enteric fever.",
    "Identify management strategies for neonates, children, and adolescents with typhoid fever.",
    "Recognize the impact of comorbidities and social factors on treatment and outcomes.",
    "Learn the appropriate use of antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins, in special populations."
  ],
  "key_facts": [
    "Neonatal typhoid is rare and may present as nonspecific sepsis; cefotaxime is preferred over ceftriaxone due to bilirubin safety concerns.",
    "Infants and toddlers often present with diarrhea and dehydration, requiring a lower threshold for admission due to rapid deterioration risk.",
    "Preschool and school-age children may show classic typhoid signs like abdominal pain and hepatosplenomegaly; outpatient care is possible with assured follow-up.",
    "Adolescents resemble adult patterns but are at risk for late complications if diagnosis is delayed.",
    "Children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), immunocompromise, or hemoglobinopathies may require prolonged therapy and closer monitoring.",
    "Social factors, such as poor follow-up ability, should lower the threshold for admission or supervised therapy.",
    "Evidence-based supportive care measures are essential"
