    "Understand the clinical presentation and management of typhoid encephalopathy, including dexamethasone dosing.",
    "Recognize hepatic involvement in typhoid fever and differentiate it from other causes of jaundice.",
    "Identify and manage rare complications such as myocarditis and secondary HLH in enteric fever."
  ],
  "key_facts": [
    "Typhoid encephalopathy requires dexamethasone: 3 mg/kg loading dose followed by 1 mg/kg every 6 hours for 48 hours.",
    "Hepatic involvement often presents with mild transaminase elevation and hepatomegaly; jaundice warrants evaluation for viral hepatitis or cholangitis.",
    "Myocarditis is rare but potentially fatal; suspect it with persistent tachycardia, arrhythmia, or unexplained shock.",
    "Secondary HLH is characterized by persistent fever, cytopenias, organomegaly, hyperferritinemia, or coagulopathy.",
    "Management of HLH includes infection treatment and immunomodulatory therapy, often corticosteroids."
