    "Understand the limitations of serologic tests, including the Widal test, in diagnosing typhoid fever.",
    "Identify appropriate diagnostic tests based on the stage of illness in typhoid and enteric fever.",
    "Recognize the role of blood, bone marrow, stool, and urine cultures in typhoid diagnosis.",
    "Evaluate the utility and limitations of molecular tests and rapid antibody kits."

  "key_facts": [
    "The Widal test is prone to false positives in endemic areas and false negatives in early illness or post-antibiotic use.",
    "National guidelines discourage using a single Widal result for diagnosis; paired rising titers are more meaningful but rarely inform acute decisions.",
    "Blood culture is the preferred diagnostic test in the first week of illness and remains useful up to 14 days.",
    "Bone marrow culture is recommended in cases of high suspicion with repeatedly negative blood cultures.",
    "Stool and urine cultures are not first-line for acute diagnosis but are useful for outbreak investigations and carrier detection.",
    "Molecular tests (e.g., PCR) are not yet standard due to cost, availability, and limited validation."
