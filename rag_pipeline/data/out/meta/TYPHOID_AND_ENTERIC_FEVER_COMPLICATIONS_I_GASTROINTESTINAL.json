    "Most bleeds are self-limited, but recurrent or massive bleeding requires urgent senior review and possible surgical or endoscopic intervention.",
    "Intestinal perforation presents with severe abdominal pain, guarding, rigidity, distension, or shock and requires immediate surgical repair.",
    "Antibiotics for perforation must cover Salmonella and secondary intra-abdominal contamination, including anaerobes.",
    "Evidence-based supportive care measures are essential"
