    "Carbapenems like meropenem (40 mg/kg every 8 hours) are reserved for severe or extensively drug-resistant typhoid.",
    "De-escalation to the narrowest effective oral agent is recommended once culture results confirm susceptibility.",
    "Full-course completion is essential to reduce relapse and transmission."
