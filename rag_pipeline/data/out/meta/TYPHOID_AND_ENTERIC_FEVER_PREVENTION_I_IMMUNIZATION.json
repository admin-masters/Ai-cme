    "TCV provides T-cell\u2013dependent immunity and longer protection compared to Vi polysaccharide vaccines.",
    "Vi polysaccharide vaccine is not immunogenic in children under 2 years and requires repeat dosing.",
    "TCV can be coadministered with other routine childhood vaccines at separate sites.",
    "Vaccination does not protect against Salmonella Paratyphi A, necessitating WASH measures.",
    "National advisory groups (e.g., NTAGI) recommend phased public schedule implementation."
