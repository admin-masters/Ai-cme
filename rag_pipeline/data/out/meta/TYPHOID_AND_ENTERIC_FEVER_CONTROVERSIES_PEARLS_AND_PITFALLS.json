  "learning_objectives": [
    "Understand the diagnostic challenges and limitations of serological tests like Widal in endemic areas.",
    "Learn appropriate antibiotic stewardship practices, including de-escalation based on susceptibility data.",
    "Recognize the indications for corticosteroid use in severe enteric fever cases.",
    "Appreciate the role of vaccination and WASH measures in reducing typhoid incidence."
  ],
  "key_facts": [
    "Fever may persist for up to 7 days on effective therapy, especially with cephalosporins.",
    "Widal test results are unreliable in endemic areas and should not replace culture-based diagnosis.",
    "Empiric fluoroquinolones are generally avoided in children due to resistance and safety concerns.",
    "High-dose dexamethasone is reserved for enteric fever with shock or encephalopathy.",
    "Vaccination reduces typhoid but not paratyphoid; WASH measures remain essential for prevention."
