    "Relapse typically occurs within 1\u20133 weeks after completing therapy and presents with milder symptoms.",
    "Persistent Salmonella shedding in stool is transient during convalescence; chronic carriage is rare in children.",
    "Routine stool cultures are not recommended for well pediatric patients but may be targeted in outbreaks or food handlers.",
    "Children can return to school once afebrile, clinically well, and able to participate normally.",
    "Strict hand hygiene and safe water practices are essential to reduce household transmission during recovery."
