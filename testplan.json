        "sequence_no": 2,
        "concept": "India bears a significant burden of enteric fever, predominantly driven by fecal–oral contamination of water and food, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation, overcrowded housing, and unsafe municipal water storage. Surveillance data from urban regions reveal an alarmingly high annual incidence among children, often ranging from hundreds to over a thousand cases per 100,000 in densely populated settlements. In contrast, rural areas exhibit substantially lower rates, highlighting the influence of infrastructure and household water management on disease transmission. Children and adolescents represent a significant proportion of cases, with school-age children being most commonly affected. However, clinically important disease also occurs in preschool-aged children and, occasionally, in infants. Salmonella Typhi is the predominant causative agent, while Salmonella Paratyphi A accounts for a smaller but meaningful proportion of cases in certain regions, with illness severity comparable to typhoid fever. Current typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) target Salmonella Typhi but do not protect against Paratyphi A, emphasizing the ongoing importance of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions even with improved vaccine coverage.\n\nHumans are the sole reservoir for the disease, and transmission is primarily driven by acutely infected individuals. Chronic carriers with prolonged fecal shedding contribute less frequently to pediatric cases. Risk factors include household contact with an infected individual, consumption of untreated water or street food, and living in communities with sewage–water interfaces. The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance poses a significant challenge, making prevention strategies essential to reducing disease morbidity, the economic impact on households, and the pressure on antibiotic use. Caregivers should be educated on the importance of safe water handling, proper sanitation, and avoiding high-risk food and water sources to mitigate transmission risks.",

        "concept": "Fever is the hallmark of typhoid and enteric fever in children, often persisting for days to weeks without treatment. While a step-ladder fever pattern is classically described, most paediatric cases present with continuous or fluctuating high fever without a distinct pattern. Early symptoms include malaise, headache, anorexia, myalgias, and occasionally a dry cough. Gastrointestinal manifestations typically emerge or worsen during the first week of illness, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, and abdominal distension. On examination, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are common findings, along with a coated tongue and signs of relative dehydration. Relative bradycardia (pulse–temperature dissociation) may serve as a diagnostic clue in older children but is inconsistently observed in paediatric cases. Rose spots on the trunk, though a classic feature, are uncommon, transient, and often missed, particularly in children with pigmented skin. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, ranging from apathy and confusion to severe encephalopathy, can occur later in the disease course, particularly in severe cases or when associated with shock. Complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal perforation typically arise after more than a week of untreated or partially treated illness, necessitating vigilant and repeated abdominal examinations. In younger children, the clinical presentation may mimic gastroenteritis or sepsis, with fewer classic signs of enteric fever, whereas older children and adolescents more commonly report prominent headache and localized abdominal pain. It is important to maintain a broad clinical perspective, as co-infections are possible even when enteric fever is strongly suspected.",

        "concept": "In the clinical workflow for typhoid and enteric fever in paediatric patients, early recognition, severity stratification, and appropriate placement of care are essential. A suspected case is defined as a child in a typhoid-endemic area presenting with fever lasting at least 3–5 days without an identifiable focus, particularly if accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, or a characteristic “typhoidal” appearance. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory isolation of *Salmonella*, most commonly from a blood culture. Severity stratification at presentation is crucial. Mild illness is indicated by stable vital signs, good perfusion, preserved sensorium, and the ability to maintain oral intake without significant dehydration. Severe illness is suggested by toxemia, persistent vomiting, moderate to severe dehydration, altered mental status, bleeding manifestations, marked abdominal distension, or signs of ileus, peritonitis, or shock. Outpatient management is appropriate for children with mild illness who can drink, tolerate oral antibiotics, and exhibit no danger signs, provided reliable follow-up can be ensured within 24–48 hours. Caregivers must be given explicit return precautions for symptoms such as worsening vomiting, abdominal pain, bleeding, or lethargy. Hospital admission is warranted for infants, children unable to maintain oral intake, or those with a toxic appearance, neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected perforation, or limited access to urgent care. In admitted patients, supportive care should be initiated immediately, including fluids, antipyretics, nutritional support, and close monitoring of abdominal and neurological status. Empiric antibiotic therapy must be started promptly after obtaining appropriate cultures to confirm the diagnosis. This structured approach ensures timely identification and management of typhoid and enteric fever, minimizing complications and improving outcomes in paediatric patients.",

        "concept": "In paediatric patients, enteric fever is a common cause of prolonged fever in India, but it is frequently misdiagnosed due to over-reliance on serology, which can lead to diagnostic errors. Differential diagnosis should consider the tempo of illness, epidemiologic exposure, and targeted testing, with caution against prematurely anchoring on typhoid in cases with atypical clinical courses. Malaria and dengue are critical differentials, particularly in endemic regions, as both can present with fever, headache, and hepatosplenomegaly, and may also coexist with enteric fever. Scrub typhus and other rickettsial infections can mimic typhoid, presenting with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms; clinicians should carefully examine for an eschar and pursue region-specific diagnostic tests, especially when cultures are negative or the clinical response is atypical. Leptospirosis should be suspected in children with conjunctival suffusion, myalgias, jaundice, or a history of flood-water exposure. Viral hepatitis A or E may initially present with fever, but the presence of jaundice and significantly elevated transaminases, particularly as fever subsides, can help differentiate these conditions. Persistent fever lasting beyond two weeks, accompanied by weight loss, lymphadenopathy, or chronic symptoms, warrants evaluation for tuberculosis, occult abscesses, endocarditis, malignancies, or inflammatory conditions such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Kawasaki disease. Definitive testing for typhoid should be complemented by a thorough search for co-infections or alternative diagnoses, particularly in cases where the child fails to improve as expected on appropriate anti-typhoidal therapy. This necessitates a diagnostic “time-out” to reassess the clinical picture, reconsider differentials, and investigate potential complications or co-infections. Sampling pitfalls, interpretation guidelines, and specific sensitivity or specificity values for diagnostic tests were not specified in the source. Accurate diagnosis requires vigilance to avoid mislabeling febrile illnesses as typhoid and to ensure timely identification and management of co-existing or alternative conditions.",

        "sequence_no": 7,
        "concept": "The diagnosis of typhoid and enteric fever in paediatric patients relies primarily on blood culture, which is considered the preferred diagnostic test and should ideally be performed before initiating antibiotics. The yield of blood culture is optimized by collecting adequate blood volume—5–10 mL in older children and smaller volumes in infants—and promptly inoculating it into appropriate broth, preferably using automated culture systems where available. Early sampling within the first week of illness is crucial, as this is when culture sensitivity is highest. In cases where initial cultures are negative but clinical suspicion persists alongside ongoing fever, repeating a blood culture is reasonable, especially if antibiotics have not yet been administered. Any Salmonella isolate obtained from cultures should undergo antimicrobial susceptibility testing, with quantitative reporting of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for key agents such as ceftriaxone to guide antimicrobial stewardship and escalation decisions. Bone marrow culture, which has the highest sensitivity for detecting typhoid and enteric fever, is reserved for diagnostically challenging cases where blood cultures are negative and confirmation would alter management. Importantly, bone marrow culture may remain positive even after antibiotic administration. Supportive laboratory tests, while not diagnostic, can help reinforce clinical suspicion and identify complications. For example, complete blood count may reveal a normal or low total leukocyte count with eosinopenia, and mild transaminase elevation is common. Imaging and focused investigations should be problem-driven; abdominal ultrasound or radiography is indicated for worsening abdominal pain or distension, while cerebrospinal fluid evaluation is warranted only when meningitis or another neurologic process is suspected. Sampling pitfalls include insufficient blood volume, delayed processing, and prior antibiotic use, all of which can reduce culture yield. Clinicians must avoid prematurely ruling out typhoid fever based on a single negative culture, especially in the absence of antibiotic exposure. Interpretation of results should incorporate antimicrobial susceptibility data to ensure appropriate treatment decisions.",

        "sequence_no": 8,
        "concept": "In the diagnosis of typhoid and enteric fever in paediatric patients, certain tests and approaches should be avoided or used with caution due to their limitations and potential for misinterpretation. Serologic tests, including the Widal agglutination test, are particularly problematic. In endemic regions, background antibody titers and cross-reactivity frequently lead to false positives, while early illness and prior antibiotic use contribute to false negatives. Consequently, national guidelines advise against relying on a single Widal test result to confirm or exclude typhoid fever. If serology is used in the absence of culture facilities, a paired sample demonstrating a rising titer is more meaningful, although it rarely aids acute decision-making. Rapid antibody kits also exhibit variable performance and should not supersede clinical judgment or culture results. Molecular tests, such as PCR, are emerging but are not yet standard in routine care due to high costs, inconsistent availability, and limited programmatic validation. Test selection should align with the stage of illness. During the first week, blood culture is the diagnostic priority, alongside targeted tests for alternative febrile illnesses like malaria or dengue, depending on local epidemiology. Between days 5 and 14, blood culture remains useful, but if cultures are repeatedly negative and clinical suspicion persists, bone marrow culture may be considered in selected cases. Stool and urine cultures are not recommended as first-line tests for diagnosing acute disease, though they may become positive later and are more relevant for outbreak investigations and identifying carriers. In late or complicated illness, diagnostic efforts should focus on detecting complications while still attempting culture confirmation. Broad, indiscriminate testing panels that do not influence management should be avoided. Sampling pitfalls include the timing of specimen collection, as early illness or prior antibiotic use can reduce culture yield. Interpretation should prioritize culture results over serology or rapid antibody tests, and clinicians must avoid over-reliance on unvalidated or poorly performing assays.",

        "sequence_no": 9,
        "concept": "Uncomplicated enteric fever in children can be managed on an outpatient basis if the child is clinically stable, able to drink fluids, and shows no danger signs. Antibiotic therapy should ideally begin after obtaining a blood culture, but treatment should not be delayed in strongly suspected cases. The recommended first-line oral regimen is cefixime at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses daily, for a duration of 10–14 days. Azithromycin serves as an effective alternative, particularly in cases where cephalosporins are contraindicated or local susceptibility patterns favor its use; the dose is 20 mg/kg once daily (maximum 1 g/day) for 7 days. Co-trimoxazole, dosed according to its trimethoprim component at 8 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses for 14 days, is a stewardship-friendly option when culture results or local data confirm susceptibility. Empiric use of fluoroquinolones is generally avoided in children due to resistance concerns and pediatric safety issues. Families should be informed that fever may persist for 4–7 days even with effective treatment. The child’s clinical response should be assessed based on overall condition, oral intake, and the trend of fever spikes, rather than expecting immediate resolution of fever. Antibiotic changes within the first few days are typically unnecessary if the child shows signs of improvement. Reassessment is advised within 48 hours, and caregivers should be instructed to return urgently if the child develops worsening vomiting, abdominal pain, bleeding, lethargy, or poor oral intake. If there is no clinical improvement by days 5–7, hospital admission is warranted to evaluate for complications, alternative diagnoses, or antimicrobial resistance. Supportive care includes oral rehydration therapy, paracetamol for symptomatic relief, and ensuring adequate nutritional intake. Monitoring for adverse effects of antibiotics and clinical deterioration is essential throughout the treatment course to ensure optimal outcomes.",

        "concept": "Hospitalized children with severe or complicated enteric fever require parenteral antibiotics alongside vigilant monitoring and supportive care. The first-line regimen typically involves ceftriaxone administered at 100 mg/kg/day (maximum 4 g/day) intravenously, either once daily or in divided doses, for a duration of 10–14 days, adjusted based on clinical response and susceptibility results. Cefotaxime at 150–200 mg/kg/day divided into 3–4 doses is a suitable alternative when ceftriaxone is contraindicated, such as in cases of biliary sludging or significant hepatitis, or when local protocols favor its use. In severely ill children, combination therapy with azithromycin at 20 mg/kg/day (oral or intravenous, depending on availability) may be considered to enhance intracellular activity and expedite fever resolution, particularly if reduced cephalosporin susceptibility is suspected. For children with serious beta-lactam allergies, specialist input is essential; azithromycin-based regimens may be employed if the child is stable and susceptibility aligns with this approach. In cases of suspected intestinal perforation, antibiotic coverage must be expanded to address secondary intra-abdominal flora, including anaerobic organisms, and surgical consultation should be sought immediately. Adjunct corticosteroid therapy is reserved for critically ill children presenting with shock or encephalopathy. In such cases, dexamethasone is administered as a loading dose of 3 mg/kg, followed by 1 mg/kg every six hours for 48 hours. Supportive care measures are integral and include fluid resuscitation, glucose monitoring, temperature regulation, early nutritional support, and frequent abdominal and neurological examinations to promptly identify complications such as bleeding, perforation, or evolving organ dysfunction. Monitoring and adverse effects related to treatment were not specified in the source.",

        "sequence_no": 11,
        "concept": "Monitoring the response to treatment in culture-negative typhoid and enteric fever in children requires careful integration of clinical and laboratory parameters. The fever curve and overall clinical trajectory are key indicators of response. With effective therapy, many children demonstrate improved appetite, activity, and hemodynamics even before fever resolution, which may take 4–7 days, particularly with cephalosporins. Persistent fever during the first week of treatment does not necessarily indicate failure if the child appears less toxic and shows improved oral intake. However, structured reassessment is essential if there is clinical deterioration at any time or if by day 5–7 there is minimal improvement in both fever trends and overall condition. Reassessment should include a detailed history and examination, evaluation of antibiotic dosing and adherence, and targeted investigations for complications such as perforation, bleeding, or abscess, as well as alternative diagnoses and co-infections. Culture-negative typhoid is common in children who present late or have received prior antibiotics. If clinical suspicion remains high and the child is improving, it is recommended to complete the planned course of therapy and ensure close follow-up rather than pursuing low-yield diagnostic tests. In cases of high suspicion with poor clinical response, repeat blood cultures should be performed, and bone marrow culture may be considered selectively to confirm the diagnosis and guide escalation of therapy. Routine “test of cure” cultures are unnecessary in cases of uncomplicated recovery. For hospitalized children showing improvement on parenteral therapy, transitioning to an appropriate oral antibiotic, guided by susceptibility data when available, is advised once the child is stable and tolerating feeds. This step-down approach helps complete the total treatment duration of 10–14 days while minimizing line-related complications and reducing the length of hospital stay.",

        "sequence_no": 12,
        "concept": "Antimicrobial resistance and stewardship are critical considerations in the management of enteric fever in paediatric patients, particularly in India, where resistance patterns are evolving and significantly impact empiric therapy. Resistance should be suspected in children who fail to show meaningful clinical improvement by day 5–7 of appropriate antimicrobial therapy with good adherence or when culture results demonstrate non-susceptibility. Clinicians must work closely with microbiology laboratories to ensure susceptibility testing is performed for relevant agents and to obtain minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values when available, as “susceptible” categories may sometimes mask reduced susceptibility associated with slower clinical response or treatment failure. Fluoroquinolone resistance and reduced susceptibility are prevalent, making fluoroquinolones unsuitable for empiric therapy in children. If reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone is identified and the child is clinically stable, azithromycin is often the preferred alternative, provided the organism is susceptible. However, in cases of severe illness, clinical deterioration, or confirmed ceftriaxone-resistant or extensively drug-resistant typhoid, escalation to a carbapenem such as meropenem (40 mg/kg every 8 hours) is indicated, ideally under the guidance of a specialist. Carbapenems should be reserved for instances of proven or strongly suspected resistance to preserve their efficacy. Once culture results are available and the child demonstrates clinical improvement, therapy should be de-escalated to the narrowest effective oral agent to complete the treatment course. Antimicrobial stewardship also involves avoiding the treatment of non-typhoidal fevers based on unreliable serological tests and ensuring that children complete the full course of prescribed antibiotics to prevent relapse and reduce the risk of ongoing transmission. These measures are essential to mitigate the impact of antimicrobial resistance and to ensure the continued effectiveness of available treatments for paediatric enteric fever.",

His parents report good adherence to the prescribed therapy, but his fever persists, and he remains lethargic. On examination, he is febrile (39.2°C), with mild abdominal distension and generalized tenderness without guarding. There are no signs of hemodynamic instability. Blood culture results now reveal reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone. The local microbiology lab notes no fluoroquinolone susceptibility testing was performed.

        "sequence_no": 13,
        "concept": "Gastrointestinal bleeding in typhoid and enteric fever arises from ulceration of Peyer’s patches, typically occurring after more than a week of illness, particularly when treatment is delayed or incomplete. Early complications include gastrointestinal bleeding, which should be suspected in children presenting with melena, hematochezia, pallor, tachycardia out of proportion to fever, or an unexplained fall in hemoglobin. Late complications may involve intestinal perforation, a surgical emergency, which manifests as sudden severe abdominal pain, guarding or rigidity, progressive distension, or shock; paradoxically, fever may subside as peritonitis develops. Red-flag warning signs include massive or recurrent bleeding, hemodynamic instability, and clinical features of perforation, all of which necessitate urgent escalation of care. The pathophysiology of gastrointestinal bleeding in this context is linked to the necrosis and ulceration of inflamed Peyer’s patches in the ileum, which can erode into blood vessels, while intestinal perforation occurs when these ulcers extend through the bowel wall, leading to peritonitis and secondary intra-abdominal contamination. Bedside monitoring should focus on hemodynamic assessment, including vital signs, perfusion status, and serial hemoglobin levels. Immediate steps include securing intravenous access, type and cross-matching blood, and initiating transfusion if clinically indicated. Children with suspected perforation must be kept nil per os, and aggressive fluid resuscitation should be started promptly. Imaging, such as abdominal X-rays or ultrasound, may be helpful but should not delay surgical intervention. Senior review and consultation with pediatric surgery or endoscopy teams should be sought urgently for massive bleeding or suspected perforation. Definitive management of gastrointestinal bleeding involves supportive care, with most cases resolving spontaneously. However, recurrent or severe bleeding may require endoscopic or surgical intervention depending on local resources. For intestinal perforation, broad-spectrum antibiotics covering Salmonella and anaerobes are essential, along with operative repair and peritoneal washout. Postoperative care necessitates intensive monitoring, ongoing antibiotics, and vigilance for complications such as abscess formation or sepsis. Long-term follow-up should ensure resolution of infection and monitor for any sequelae.",

        "sequence_no": 14,
        "concept": "Neurologic and hepatic complications of typhoid and enteric fever in children require prompt recognition and management due to their potential severity. Early neurologic complications include typhoid encephalopathy, which presents with delirium, confusion, obtundation, or coma in a systemically toxic child. This necessitates immediate escalation of care, including stabilization of the airway and circulation, correction of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalances, treatment of shock, and administration of effective parenteral antibiotics. For severe cases with encephalopathy or shock, adjunctive dexamethasone is recommended using a short, high-dose regimen of a 3 mg/kg loading dose followed by 1 mg/kg every six hours for 48 hours. Alternative neurologic diagnoses should be excluded when clinically indicated, but lumbar puncture should not be performed reflexively. Hepatic involvement is common and typically manifests as mild transaminase elevation with hepatomegaly. Jaundice, however, warrants evaluation for viral hepatitis or cholangitis. Hepatic management is primarily supportive, emphasizing the avoidance of hepatotoxic drugs and continuation of appropriate antibiotics. Red-flag warning signs include persistent tachycardia disproportionate to fever, arrhythmias, gallop rhythm, or unexplained shock, which may indicate myocarditis, a rare but potentially fatal complication. In such cases, electrocardiography and echocardiography should be performed, cardiology consultation sought, and hemodynamic support provided alongside infection treatment. Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is another critical but rare complication, suspected in children with persistent or recrudescent fever despite therapy, cytopenias, organomegaly, hyperferritinemia, or coagulopathy. This requires urgent evaluation, specialist consultation, infection treatment, and initiation of immunomodulatory therapy, often with corticosteroids. The pathophysiology of these complications is not specified in the source. Bedside monitoring should focus on neurologic status, hepatic function, cardiac parameters, and systemic signs of inflammation. Escalation of care is warranted for any signs of encephalopathy, jaundice with suspected cholangitis, cardiac instability, or features suggestive of HLH. Definitive management includes targeted antibiotic therapy, supportive care, and adjunctive treatments as indicated, with follow-up tailored to the resolution of complications and overall recovery.",

        "sequence_no": 15,
        "concept": "Age significantly influences the clinical presentation and management of typhoid and enteric fever in paediatric populations, as well as the threshold for hospital admission. Neonatal typhoid is exceedingly rare but may manifest as nonspecific sepsis with symptoms such as poor feeding, abdominal distension, or shock. Management in neonates requires hospitalisation with sepsis protocols, and cefotaxime is preferred over ceftriaxone in early infancy due to bilirubin-related safety concerns. Infants and toddlers often present with diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with fewer classic signs of typhoid fever. In these younger age groups, the threshold for admission is lower because of the risk of rapid deterioration and unreliable oral therapy. Preschool and school-age children are more likely to exhibit abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and a typical “typhoidal” appearance. Selected uncomplicated cases in these age groups may be managed as outpatients, provided follow-up is assured. Adolescents tend to display patterns of illness similar to adults and are at risk for late complications if diagnosis is delayed. Special populations within paediatrics require heightened vigilance. Children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), chronic diseases, or immunocompromise (e.g., HIV or chemotherapy) may have blunted clinical signs, higher bacteremia burden, and slower recovery. These children often require longer courses of treatment and closer monitoring, with broader differentials including invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella. Children with hemoglobinopathies are particularly susceptible to focal Salmonella infections, such as osteomyelitis, which necessitate targeted imaging and prolonged therapy if persistent localized pain or swelling is present. Social factors also play a critical role across all paediatric age groups. Poor ability to return for follow-up or uncertain adherence to therapy should lower the threshold for hospital admission or supervised therapy to ensure optimal outcomes.",

        "concept": "Clinical follow-up in paediatric patients recovering from typhoid and enteric fever focuses on confirming recovery, identifying relapse, and reinforcing preventive measures. While most children show rapid improvement once effective antibiotics are initiated, fatigue and weight loss may persist for weeks, necessitating counselling for families on nutrition and a gradual return to normal activities. Families should be advised to ensure the full course of antibiotics is completed, even if early improvement is observed, to reduce the risk of relapse. Relapse typically occurs within 1–3 weeks after completing therapy and usually presents as recurrent fever with a milder clinical presentation. In such cases, relapse should be managed as a new episode by obtaining cultures if possible, reviewing prior adherence to treatment and antibiotic choice, and initiating a full course of therapy guided by susceptibility testing. If fever recurs with focal symptoms, such as bone pain or localized tenderness, evaluation for focal Salmonella complications is warranted, and therapy should be extended as necessary. Persistent Salmonella shedding in stool may occur transiently during convalescence, but true chronic carriage is rare in children. Routine post-illness stool cultures are not recommended for otherwise well paediatric patients. However, targeted stool culture follow-up is appropriate in specific scenarios, such as during outbreaks, in recurrent family clusters, or when an older adolescent involved in food handling is affected. If a carrier state is confirmed, prolonged antibiotic therapy guided by sensitivity testing and coordination with public health authorities may be required. Children can generally return to school once they are afebrile, clinically well, and able to participate in normal activities. Emphasis should be placed on strict hand hygiene and safe water practices to reduce household transmission during the recovery period.",

        "sequence_no": 18,
        "concept": "Prevention of typhoid and enteric fever in paediatric populations relies heavily on interrupting fecal–oral transmission through water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) measures, as well as timely public health interventions during outbreaks. Screening or testing recommendations for children are not specified in the source. Families should be counselled on ensuring safe drinking water by boiling or using reliable filtration methods, practicing handwashing with soap after toileting and before handling food, and avoiding high-risk uncooked foods and unsafe street beverages. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for contacts is generally discouraged due to the risk of promoting antimicrobial resistance; instead, caregivers should be educated to seek prompt medical attention for children presenting with fever. Targeted stool testing and treatment of identified adult carriers, particularly food handlers, may be necessary, with clearance required before they resume food preparation duties.\n\nSanitation and food/water hygiene measures are critical, especially during outbreaks. Immediate control actions may include chlorination of water supplies, cleaning of storage tanks, temporary closure of implicated kitchens, and community messaging emphasizing boiling water and maintaining hand hygiene. Outbreak response involves confirming cases through cultures from early patients, performing rapid assessments of common exposures, and inspecting and testing water sources and food handling sites. Reactive typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) campaigns may be considered during outbreaks, where feasible, to reduce transmission, alongside sustained improvements in infrastructure.\n\nFamilies should be advised on return precautions, including seeking medical care for children with febrile illnesses, but specific thresholds or timing for return precautions are not specified in the source. In the event of multiple suspected or confirmed cases in a locality, school, or hostel, clinicians must notify local public health authorities and surveillance systems, such as the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), to initiate investigations and implement source control measures. Community and outbreak reporting are essential to ensure timely interventions and prevent further spread of the disease.",

        "concept": "In the management of typhoid and enteric fever in paediatric patients, several controversies, pearls, and pitfalls must be carefully considered. A common pitfall is misinterpreting persistent fever as antibiotic failure; fever may take up to a week to resolve, particularly with cephalosporin therapy. The clinical response should be assessed based on toxicity, oral intake, and hemodynamic stability, and antibiotics should only be changed early if the child shows clear worsening or fails to improve by day 5–7. Diagnostic overconfidence based on serology, especially a “Widal-positive” result, is another frequent error in endemic areas, as this test does not confirm typhoid and may divert attention from other conditions such as malaria, dengue, rickettsioses, tuberculosis, malignancy, or inflammatory diseases. Prioritising culture-based diagnosis and scheduling diagnostic time-outs can mitigate this risk. Classic findings such as rose spots and relative bradycardia, while supportive when present, are often absent in children; their absence should not reduce clinical suspicion if the overall syndrome aligns with typhoid fever. Antimicrobial stewardship is crucial, requiring restraint in unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic escalation and de-escalation based on susceptibility data. Renewed sensitivity to older agents in some regions offers opportunities to spare azithromycin and third-generation cephalosporins when culture confirms susceptibility. Empiric fluoroquinolones are generally avoided in children due to resistance and safety concerns, despite occasional debates about their use in exceptional scenarios. Corticosteroids have a narrow indication in paediatric typhoid fever and should be reserved for cases with shock or encephalopathy; routine use is not recommended. Vaccination against typhoid reduces disease incidence but does not protect against paratyphoid fever, so clinicians must remain vigilant for enteric fever even in vaccinated children. Maintaining robust WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) measures remains the cornerstone of durable prevention strategies.",

He was started on ceftriaxone at a local clinic 3 days ago, but his fever persists, and his parents report worsening lethargy. On examination, he is febrile (39.5°C), mildly dehydrated, and has a soft, distended abdomen with mild tenderness but no guarding or rebound. No rose spots are visible. A Widal test done at the clinic was positive, but no blood culture was performed. Malaria and dengue rapid tests were negative. The treating physician is unsure whether to escalate antibiotics or continue current therapy. The child’s vitals are stable, with a heart rate of 112 bpm and blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg.",
