            "concept": "Nutritional assessment in adolescents involves three key methods: anthropometry, biochemical tests, and dietary surveys. Anthropometric tools are essential for evaluating growth and nutritional status. Growth charts, such as WHO Child Growth Standards (for 0–5 years) and IAP growth charts (for Indian children aged 5–18 years), serve as reference tools. Parameters like weight, height, and BMI-for-age are plotted to calculate Z-scores or percentiles for indices such as weight-for-age, height-for-age, weight-for-height, and BMI-for-age. Severe wasting (SAM) is flagged by a weight-for-height Z-score below –3, while underweight and stunting are identified by weight-for-age and height-for-age Z-scores below –2 SD, respectively. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is a quick community tool, with MUAC <115 mm indicating severe acute malnutrition and 115–125 mm indicating moderate acute malnutrition. For infants, head circumference percentiles assess chronic nutrition or brain growth. Skinfold calipers measure triceps and subscapular thickness to estimate fat stores, and upper arm muscle circumference (derived from MUAC and skinfold thickness) reflects muscle mass. Growth velocity, calculated as weight or height change over time, is another critical indicator; crossing two major centile lines downward on growth charts signals faltering growth. Dietary surveys complement anthropometric assessments by evaluating nutrient intake. The 24-hour dietary recall provides quantitative estimates of calorie, protein, and micronutrient intake, which are compared to recommended dietary allowances for the child’s age. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) semi-quantitatively assess the frequency of consumption of various food groups, identifying potential nutritional gaps like low intake of iron-rich foods. Structured diet history forms capture usual meal patterns and feeding rituals, while 3-day diet diaries offer a representative sample of intake. Observing feeding sessions provides qualitative insights into feeding dynamics, such as breastfeeding efficacy or oral-motor function. Biochemical tests are crucial for detecting deficiencies and metabolic consequences. Hemoglobin levels below 11 g/dL (WHO threshold for ages 6–59 months) indicate anemia, often due to iron deficiency. Serum ferritin <12–15 µg/L confirms depleted iron stores but may be masked by infection due to its acute-phase sensitivity. Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) is assessed in cases of rickets, poor growth, or risk factors like limited sun exposure. Thyroid function tests (T4 and TSH) are performed in cases of growth retardation or excessive weight gain to rule out hypothyroidism. Screening for celiac disease with IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies is considered in cases of short stature linked to malabsorption.",

            "concept": "Identifying and diagnosing iron deficiency anemia in adolescents requires a systematic approach to clinical features, differential diagnoses, definitive testing, sampling considerations, and interpretation guidelines. Core clinical features of iron deficiency anemia in adolescents include fatigue, pallor, reduced exercise tolerance, and cognitive difficulties. Severe cases may present with symptoms such as tachycardia, dizziness, or delayed growth and development. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable due to increased iron requirements during growth spurts and dietary deficiencies, especially in populations with limited access to iron-rich foods. Key differentials to consider include anemia of chronic disease, thalassemia, and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Anemia of chronic disease may mimic iron deficiency anemia but typically presents with normal or elevated ferritin levels and reduced transferrin saturation. Thalassemia, especially in regions with high prevalence, should be considered when microcytosis is disproportionate to the degree of anemia. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anemia can be distinguished by macrocytosis and neurological symptoms. Definitive tests for diagnosing iron deficiency anemia include serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels. Serum ferritin is the most sensitive marker for iron stores, with levels <12 ng/mL indicating depleted iron stores. However, ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and may be elevated in inflammatory states, potentially masking iron deficiency. Transferrin saturation <16% is also diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia. Peripheral blood smear findings, such as microcytic hypochromic red blood cells, support the diagnosis. Sampling pitfalls include improper timing of ferritin testing during acute illness, which can lead to falsely elevated results. Hemoglobin alone is insufficient for diagnosis, as it does not differentiate between types of anemia. It is essential to ensure proper sample handling and storage to avoid degradation of markers. In interpreting results, clinicians should avoid over-reliance on single parameters like ferritin without considering clinical context and other tests such as transferrin saturation. Combining laboratory findings with clinical features enhances diagnostic accuracy. Not specified in the source are guidelines for timing windows for sampling or specific sensitivity/specificity values of tests.",

            "concept": "Dietary management for adolescents with food allergies is critical to ensure adequate macronutrient intake, particularly proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, while avoiding allergenic triggers. Strict elimination of confirmed allergens, such as cow’s milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish, is the cornerstone of allergy management. However, this can pose nutritional risks if appropriate substitutions are not made. For instance, adolescents with cow’s milk protein allergy must avoid dairy products, a major source of protein, calcium, and vitamin D. To prevent deficiencies, calcium- and vitamin D-fortified alternatives like fortified soy milk, almond milk, or calcium tablets, along with calcium-rich foods such as leafy greens, ragi millet, or sesame seeds, should be incorporated into their diet. Similarly, eliminating wheat in cases of wheat allergy or celiac disease necessitates replacing it with other carbohydrate sources like rice, maize, millet, or gluten-free fortified breads and cereals to ensure adequate intake of B-vitamins and fiber. For each eliminated food, it is essential to identify nutritionally equivalent alternatives. For example, protein from eggs can be replaced with legumes, meat, or nutritional supplements. Adolescents allergic to multiple nuts and legumes, particularly those on vegetarian diets, may require alternative protein sources such as dairy (if tolerated), eggs (if not allergic), quinoa, or amino-acid-based supplements. If numerous foods are excluded, a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement is often recommended to address common deficiencies, particularly in vitamin D, calcium, iron, and zinc. Omega-3 capsules may be necessary for those avoiding fish. Monitoring growth and nutritional status is vital, as unmonitored elimination diets can lead to poor growth and micronutrient deficiencies. Individualized meal planning with a dietitian is strongly advised to balance allergen avoidance with caloric and nutrient needs. Adolescents should be educated on reading ingredient labels, identifying allergens, preventing cross-contact, and making healthy choices within their safe foods. For example, peanut-allergic teens can obtain healthy fats and protein from other nuts or seeds if tolerated. In culturally specific contexts, such as vegetarian Indian diets, hypoallergenic formulas or culturally appropriate substitutes like finger millet or amaranth flour may be necessary to meet protein and calorie requirements.",

She has recently started avoiding wheat due to abdominal discomfort and bloating after consumption. On focused examination, she appears thin with a BMI at the 5th percentile for age and mild pallor. Her height is at the 10th percentile, and she has delayed secondary sexual characteristics.

            "sequence_no": 5,
            "concept": "Adolescent dietary habits in India are shaped by a complex interplay of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, making it essential for paediatric practitioners to understand these determinants when addressing nutritional challenges. Socioeconomic status (SES) significantly impacts food availability, affordability, and quality. Adolescents from low-income families often face limited access to nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, milk, and meats due to cost constraints, relying instead on cheaper staples like rice or roti and calorie-dense, nutrient-poor options such as fried snacks or sugar-sweetened beverages. This dietary pattern contributes to a dual burden of undernutrition (due to vitamin and mineral deficiencies) and obesity (from high sugar and fat intake). For instance, a low-income rural adolescent girl may subsist on rice with salt and oil or watery dal, leading to deficiencies, while an affluent urban adolescent may overconsume fast foods and sugary drinks, contributing to overweight and obesity. Research indicates that overweight and obesity prevalence is higher among adolescents from high-SES families, driven by greater access to high-calorie foods, lifestyle transitions, and exposure to Western-style fast foods aggressively marketed in urban areas. High-SES families often have a culture of eating out or ordering in, further increasing fat and salt intake. Conversely, food insecurity in low-SES households can result in meal skipping or reliance on starchy staples, with occasional indulgence in energy-dense foods leading to a \"feast and famine\" cycle that exacerbates fat deposition. Urban-rural disparities further compound these SES-driven dietary patterns. Urban adolescents, particularly from lower-income groups, often rely on cheap street foods like pakoras, samosas, and sweetened drinks, while rural adolescents consume more traditional diets when available. Urban food environments, characterized by proximity to fast-food outlets and aggressive marketing of processed snacks and sugary beverages, are increasingly obesogenic. Nutrition knowledge and attitudes also vary by SES; adolescents from more educated families may have better awareness of healthy eating but may not act on it due to peer influence or availability of unhealthy options. Effective interventions must therefore be tailored: improving access to affordable, nutritious foods in low-SES settings (e.g., midday meals, supplementation, food fortification) and addressing excess consumption and junk food appeal in high-SES settings. Family and peer environments remain critical, as adolescents typically consume what is available at home and are influenced by social norms.",

            "concept": "The clinical management of adolescent undernutrition, particularly in the context of severe malnutrition and eating disorders (EDs) such as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED), requires clearly defined criteria for admission, stabilization, and discharge. Admission and escalation criteria focus on vital signs, hydration status, neurological symptoms, and evidence of bleeding. Hospitalization is warranted if an adolescent presents with significant bradycardia (<50 bpm), hypotension (<90/60 mmHg), or electrolyte disturbances, as these can indicate severe malnutrition and pose a risk for cardiac arrest or other complications. Dehydration may manifest as tachycardia, hypotension, or dizziness upon standing, while hypothermia, lanugo hair, acrocyanosis, and edema are additional markers of severe malnutrition in AN. Neurological concerns such as dizziness or fatigue, as well as physical signs like Russell’s sign (calluses on knuckles from induced vomiting) or parotid hypertrophy, are particularly relevant in BN. Bleeding-related complications, such as anemia or leukopenia due to marrow suppression, may be identified through laboratory tests. Initial laboratory investigations include a complete blood count (CBC) to detect anemia or leukopenia, electrolyte panels to identify hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting), or metabolic acidosis (from laxative abuse), and liver function tests to assess starvation or binge-related damage. Thyroid function tests may reveal euthyroid sick syndrome in malnourished adolescents. Electrocardiograms are essential to monitor for bradycardia and prolonged QT intervals, which are common in severe AN. Stabilization steps involve nutritional rehabilitation and careful refeeding to avoid complications such as refeeding syndrome. Hospital admission is often necessary to ensure medical stability in adolescents with severe malnutrition, especially those with significant cardiovascular or electrolyte abnormalities. Thresholds for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) are not specified in the source. Discharge and review triggers include the resolution of acute medical instability, such as normalization of vital signs and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Long-term management requires coordinated care involving pediatricians and mental health professionals to address nutritional rehabilitation and psychological recovery. Specific criteria for discharge and outpatient follow-up are not specified in the source.",

On examination, she has a BMI of 13 kg/m², visible lanugo hair on her back, and mild bilateral pedal edema. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 48 bpm and blood pressure of 88/58 mmHg. Laboratory tests show hypokalemia (serum potassium 2.8 mmol/L) and metabolic alkalosis. Despite initial outpatient treatment with oral potassium and nutritional counseling, she returns on day 3 with persistent dizziness and worsening fatigue.",

            "concept": "The approach to diagnosing and managing adolescent obesity involves understanding BMI thresholds and implementing preventive interventions across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Core clinical features include using BMI percentiles to identify weight status. Adolescents with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles are classified as overweight, while those exceeding the 95th percentile are considered obese. Early identification of rapid weight gain, such as crossing from the 75th to the 90th percentile, is critical to prevent progression to obesity and associated complications like fatty liver, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Key differentials in adolescent obesity include distinguishing between simple obesity due to lifestyle factors and secondary causes such as endocrine disorders, genetic syndromes, or eating disorders. Screening for warning signs, such as obsessive food talk or sudden weight loss, can help identify underlying eating disorders, while assessing nutritional status in athletes (e.g., menstrual irregularities in female athletes) can detect relative energy deficiency syndromes. Definitive tests for diagnosing obesity primarily involve BMI calculation during routine health check-ups. Growth monitoring, including plotting BMI and height, is essential for early detection of weight trends. Laboratory screenings for vitamin deficiencies or anemia in high-risk populations may also aid in identifying nutritional imbalances contributing to weight issues. Sensitivity and specificity values for these tests are not specified in the source. Sampling pitfalls include failing to account for age, sex, and pubertal stage when interpreting BMI percentiles, as these factors significantly influence growth patterns. Additionally, reliance solely on BMI without considering other clinical and laboratory parameters may lead to missed diagnoses of secondary causes of obesity. Interpretation dos and don’ts emphasize timely intervention at early stages. For overweight adolescents, dietary counseling and lifestyle modifications should be initiated before complications develop. Tertiary prevention focuses on managing established obesity-related conditions, such as type 2 diabetes or hypertension, with medical treatments like metformin or antihypertensives, alongside diet and exercise plans. Rehabilitation strategies aim to prevent further deterioration and long-term complications like kidney damage or cardiovascular disease.",

            "concept": "Micronutrient supplementation protocols for iron, folic acid, and vitamin A in adolescents are critical components of pediatric care, especially given the heightened vulnerability of this age group to deficiencies. Adolescents experience increased nutritional demands due to the growth spurt during puberty, with additional challenges for girls due to menstrual iron loss. In India, anemia prevalence among adolescent girls is approximately 40%, significantly higher than the 18% observed in boys. Iron deficiency, indicated by low ferritin levels, affects 31% of adolescent girls compared to 12% of boys. Folate deficiency is similarly pronounced in girls, with 37% affected, alongside 31% exhibiting vitamin B12 deficiency, largely due to inadequate dietary intake in resource-limited settings. Vitamin A deficiency, while historically more common in preschoolers, remains a concern in adolescents, particularly in communities with limited access to nutrient-rich foods. Vitamin D deficiency also increases with age, affecting one in four teenagers, likely due to lifestyle factors such as reduced sun exposure and higher requirements during adolescence. For bedside decision-making, pediatricians should prioritize targeted interventions for adolescents, especially girls, to address these deficiencies. Weekly iron-folic acid supplementation programs, such as those implemented in schools under initiatives like Anaemia Mukt Bharat (Anemia-Free India), are essential to combat anemia and improve folate status. Practical supplementation strategies should be complemented by food fortification, which is a cornerstone of India’s public health efforts to combat hidden hunger. Fortified staples such as rice and wheat flour are enriched with iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12, while edible salt is double-fortified with iodine and iron. Cooking oils and packaged milk are fortified with vitamins A and D, addressing deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins crucial for vision, immunity, and bone health. These fortified foods, marked with the “+F” logo, ensure adolescents receive essential nutrients even in simple meals, reducing reliance on diverse diets that may be inaccessible to lower-income groups. Pediatricians should advocate for these programs and ensure adolescents, particularly girls, are screened for deficiencies and receive appropriate supplementation and fortified foods to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition.",

            "sequence_no": 9,
            "concept": "Nutrition-related complications in adolescents, such as anemia, stunting, and metabolic syndrome, require early recognition and timely management to prevent long-term consequences. Early complications include mild anemia, which can progress to severe anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) if unaddressed, leading to cognitive deficits and growth impacts. Growth faltering, indicated by deviations in height-for-age or BMI percentiles, can signal stunting or early obesity, while rapid weight gain (e.g., crossing from the 75th to 90th BMI percentile) may precede metabolic syndrome. Late complications include established malnutrition-related diseases such as severe anemia requiring hospitalization and transfusion, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or complications like fatty liver, kidney damage, or cardiovascular issues. Red-flag warning signs include sudden weight loss, obsessive preoccupation with food, or unhealthy weight control practices, which may indicate eating disorders. In athletes, irregular menstrual cycles or signs of relative energy deficiency warrant early intervention to prevent stress fractures or amenorrhea. The pathophysiology of these complications often stems from inadequate or imbalanced nutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, or excess caloric intake. For example, iodine deficiency can impair cognitive development, while iron deficiency leads to anemia. Overnutrition, combined with sedentary behavior, contributes to metabolic syndrome and obesity-related comorbidities. Bedside monitoring involves regular growth tracking through BMI and height-for-age plotting, annual anemia screening (particularly for adolescent girls), and laboratory tests for micronutrient deficiencies in high-risk populations. Questionnaires can help identify unhealthy eating behaviors, while clinical assessments for signs of malnutrition or obesity-related complications guide further action. Escalation of care is necessary for severe cases, such as hospitalization for hemoglobin <7 g/dL or referral to specialists for diabetes or hypertension management. Definitive management includes primary prevention strategies like promoting balanced diets, universal fortification (e.g., iodized salt, iron-fortified rice), and deworming every six months in endemic areas. Secondary prevention focuses on early detection and intervention, such as iron supplementation for anemia or dietary counseling for overweight adolescents. Tertiary prevention aims to rehabilitate and manage established conditions, such as using metformin for diabetes or antihypertensives for hypertension, alongside lifestyle modifications. Follow-up ensures adherence to interventions and prevents recurrence or further complications.",

            "concept": "Counselling adolescents on physical activity as part of weight management requires a motivational and culturally adapted approach tailored to their unique preferences and lifestyle. Physical activity is essential for weight control and overall health, complementing dietary measures and offering psychological benefits, such as reducing stress-eating. However, globally and in India, 81% of school-going adolescents aged 11–17 do not meet the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Pediatricians and health providers must actively promote physical activity as a key lifestyle habit through positive, engaging counselling techniques and programmatic integration, such as school sports and community initiatives. Effective counselling begins with assessing the adolescent’s baseline activity and interests. Many adolescents may not engage in structured exercise but might enjoy activities like sports (e.g., football, badminton, basketball), dance, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking with friends. Questions such as “What do you like to do for fun?” or “Do you have any sports or outdoor games you enjoy?” can help identify enjoyable activities. Emphasize that any movement is beneficial, including participation in physical education classes, walking or biking to school, or doing active household chores. The ultimate goal is to meet the WHO guideline of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily, which can be accumulated throughout the day if doing it in one session feels overwhelming. For example, three 20-minute bursts of activity—morning, school recess, and evening—are equally effective. Moderate activity is defined as movement where one can talk but not sing, while vigorous activity involves exertion where only a few words can be spoken without pausing for breath. Additionally, muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening exercises, such as climbing, push-ups, or jumping, should be included at least three days a week. Counsellors should address common barriers, such as the misconception that only structured exercise counts, by suggesting creative alternatives like walking instead of taking a rickshaw, dancing to music at home, or taking the stairs at school. Adolescents may also find step-count goals (e.g., 10,000 steps daily) motivating, especially when paired with technology like fitness apps, pedometers, or active video games. By framing physical activity positively and integrating it into daily routines, pediatricians can enhance adherence, helping adolescents achieve better physical and psychological health outcomes.",

            "sequence_no": 11,
            "concept": "Adolescent nutrition in India is profoundly influenced by regional dietary practices, socioeconomic status (SES), and cultural norms, which are further complicated by fasting periods and menstruation. Adolescents' dietary choices are shaped not only by individual preferences but also by family income, parental education, peer influence, media exposure, and psychological well-being. SES plays a pivotal role in determining food availability and affordability, leading to stark contrasts in nutritional outcomes. In low-income families, adolescents often rely on inexpensive staples like rice or roti and calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods such as fried snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages. This dietary pattern contributes to undernutrition, with deficiencies in protein and micronutrients, and paradoxically, obesity due to high sugar and fat intake. Conversely, adolescents from high-SES families, particularly in urban areas, are more likely to consume fast foods, sugary drinks, and packaged snacks, which are aggressively marketed and readily available. This lifestyle transition has led to higher rates of overweight and obesity among affluent youth. Urban-rural disparities further compound these issues. Urban adolescents, especially those from low-income households, often depend on cheap street foods like pakoras, samosas, or sweetened beverages for satiety, while rural adolescents may consume more traditional diets if available. However, urban food environments are increasingly obesogenic, with fast-food outlets and convenience foods dominating the landscape. Cultural practices, such as fasting during religious observances, can exacerbate nutritional challenges. Adolescents may skip meals or consume energy-dense foods during non-fasting periods, leading to erratic intake patterns that can impair nutritional status. During menstruation, adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to iron deficiency due to increased requirements, and dietary inadequacies in low-SES households, such as reliance on rice with minimal accompaniments, can worsen anemia. For paediatric practitioners, interventions must be tailored to these diverse contexts. In low-SES settings, efforts should focus on improving access to affordable, nutrient-dense foods through programs like midday meals, supplementation, and food fortification. In high-SES settings, strategies should aim to reduce the appeal of junk foods and promote moderation. Addressing these multifaceted influences requires nuanced, context-specific approaches to improve adolescent nutrition amidst India's diverse dietary and cultural landscape.",

            "concept": "Monitoring and follow-up strategies for adolescent nutrition programs should include a strong emphasis on physical activity as a critical component of weight management and overall health promotion. Physical activity complements dietary measures and provides broad health benefits, making it an essential lifestyle habit for adolescents. Globally, including in India, 81% of school-going adolescents aged 11–17 fail to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. This widespread sedentariness contributes to rising obesity and other health issues, underscoring the need for pediatricians and health providers to actively counsel adolescents on incorporating physical activity into their routines. Counseling should adopt a tailored and motivational approach, focusing on enjoyable and accessible activities rather than framing exercise as a chore or punishment. Examples include sports such as football, badminton, or basketball; activities like dance, swimming, cycling; or simpler options such as brisk walking, active household chores, or participation in physical education classes. Effective counseling begins with assessing the adolescent’s baseline activity level and interests. Questions like “What do you like to do for fun?” or “Do you have any sports or outdoor games you enjoy?” can help identify suitable activities. The goal should align with WHO guidelines, which recommend 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily for adolescents aged 5–17, including muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening exercises at least three days a week. Moderate activity is defined as movement where one can talk but not sing, while vigorous activity involves exertion that limits speech to a few words at a time. Practical examples of muscle-strengthening activities include squats, push-ups, yoga, or climbing, which do not necessarily require gym access. Counselors should address common barriers, such as misconceptions that only structured exercise counts, by suggesting creative alternatives like walking or cycling short distances, taking stairs instead of elevators, or dancing to music at home. Accumulating activity throughout the day, such as three 20-minute sessions, is a viable strategy for adolescents who find 60 minutes in one stretch challenging. Technology integration, such as fitness apps, pedometers, or active video games, can also be motivating. Physical activity not only aids weight management by burning calories, building muscle, and improving insulin sensitivity but also enhances psychological well-being, reducing stress-related eating.",

His weight is 35 kg, and height is 155 cm. A dietary recall reveals limited protein intake, consisting mostly of rice and lentils, with minimal fruits or dairy. He participates in minimal physical activity apart from walking to school. A hemoglobin test reveals 10.5 g/dL. The family expresses concerns about affordability of nutritious food options. Follow-up strategies are discussed, including dietary modifications, meal planning, and community-based nutritional support programs.",

Her mother is concerned about her weight gain and notes that she frequently snacks on packaged foods.

Her school has no structured physical education program, and her family lacks awareness of healthy lifestyle habits.

She reports feeling fatigued during school hours and struggles to concentrate on her studies. Her mother mentions that she avoids outdoor activities and prefers sedentary pastimes like watching TV after school. On examination, her BMI is 23.5 kg/m² (above the 85th percentile for her age and sex), and she has acanthosis nigricans on her neck. A dietary recall reveals frequent consumption of fried snacks and sugary beverages, with minimal intake of fruits or vegetables. She reports no structured physical activity and says she feels self-conscious participating in sports at school. A hemoglobin test shows mild anemia (10.5 g/dL). The health worker discusses her interests and finds she enjoys cycling but hasn’t done it in months due to peer pressure. The team plans tailored follow-up strategies integrating dietary advice and physical activity counseling.",

            "sequence_no": 14,
            "concept": "Nutritional interventions for adolescents with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, HIV, renal disease, and disabilities, require a structured approach across primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels to address their unique needs and prevent complications. Primary prevention focuses on averting nutritional problems before they arise by promoting healthy behaviors and ensuring access to balanced diets. For adolescents with chronic illnesses, this includes targeted nutrition education, emphasizing the importance of home-cooked meals, fruits, vegetables, and limiting junk food or sugary drinks. Universal fortification measures, such as iodized salt to prevent iodine deficiency and iron-fortified rice to reduce anemia, are critical in preventing cognitive deficits and anemia, respectively. Prophylactic deworming every six months in endemic areas is another key measure to prevent helminth-induced malnutrition. Life-skills training in schools, such as teaching adolescents to cook healthy recipes or read nutrition labels, fosters long-term healthy habits, which are particularly important for those managing chronic conditions. Secondary prevention involves early detection and intervention to halt the progression of nutritional issues. For adolescents with chronic illnesses, regular screening for anemia, vitamin deficiencies, or growth abnormalities is essential. For instance, annual anemia screening in schools, particularly for adolescent girls, followed by iron supplementation, can prevent cognitive and growth impacts. Monitoring BMI and height in pediatric clinics helps identify early growth faltering or rapid weight gain, enabling timely dietary counseling. In adolescents with diabetes or renal disease, early recognition of weight changes or unhealthy dietary practices can prevent further complications. Screening athletes for signs of relative energy deficiency, such as menstrual irregularities in female athletes, is another example of secondary prevention to avoid progression to stress fractures or amenorrhea. Tertiary prevention focuses on managing established nutritional-related diseases and preventing further complications. For adolescents with chronic illnesses, this includes comprehensive rehabilitation and medical management. For instance, adolescents with severe anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) may require hospitalization and transfusion, followed by a plan to prevent recurrence. Overweight adolescents with type 2 diabetes or hypertension require medical management, such as metformin or antihypertensives, alongside tailored diet and exercise plans to prevent complications like kidney damage or cardiovascular disease.",

            "concept": "Adolescents with disabilities, developmental delays, or chronic illnesses who have undergone treatment for severe malnutrition or nutritional rehabilitation require clearly defined discharge criteria to ensure sustained recovery at home. Although most evidence on severe acute malnutrition (SAM) focuses on children under five years, similar principles apply to older children and adolescents. Discharge is appropriate once the adolescent’s nutritional status has improved from the acute malnutrition range to a safe level, medical complications are stabilized, and the patient or caregiver demonstrates the ability to sustain nutritional gains independently. Key criteria for discharge include anthropometric recovery, resolution of clinical signs such as edema, the ability to consume an adequate diet, and a minimum period of continuous weight gain. Anthropometric recovery is central to discharge decisions. For adolescents, BMI-for-age percentiles or z-scores are used as proxies since weight-for-height charts are not standardized beyond puberty. An adolescent who was severely thin (e.g., BMI-for-age < –3 SD) can be considered nutritionally recovered when their BMI-for-age rises above –2 SD (approximately the 5th percentile for age/sex) and remains stable for at least two weeks. For example, a 14-year-old girl admitted with a BMI of 14 (–3 SD) might be ready for discharge once her BMI reaches approximately 16.5 (above –2 SD) and shows an upward trend. Alternatively, percent weight gain from admission can be used, with a commonly applied target of ≥ 15% weight gain. For instance, an adolescent girl admitted at 30 kg would meet this criterion upon reaching at least 34.5 kg. Additionally, bilateral pitting edema, a hallmark of kwashiorkor, must resolve completely and remain absent for at least two weeks before discharge to ensure stability. Clinical and functional criteria are equally important. The adolescent should be clinically stable, with any intercurrent illnesses resolved or controlled, and demonstrate a good appetite, consuming balanced meals without intensive medical support. If tube feeding was initially required, the adolescent should transition to oral feeding successfully. Nutritional counseling for the adolescent and caregiver is essential to sustain progress. Psychosocial readiness, particularly in cases linked to eating disorders, should also be assessed. Not specified in source are specific guidelines tailored to adolescents with disabilities or developmental delays.",

            "concept": "The criteria for initiating therapeutic nutritional support in adolescents with acute malnutrition involve a systematic approach to identifying and classifying malnutrition, followed by appropriate management. Malnutrition is assessed through anthropometric measurements. Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is diagnosed if the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is <115 mm, weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) is <–3, or there is bilateral pitting edema. Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) is classified if MUAC is 115–125 mm or WHZ is between –3 and –2. Children with low weight-for-age but WHZ ≥–2 are categorized as underweight or mildly malnourished, and underlying causes should be addressed. For example, an 18-month-old child weighing 6.5 kg, with a length of 72 cm, MUAC of 114 mm, and WHZ <–3 is classified as SAM. For SAM, the next step is to assess complications. The presence of edema (++ or +++), poor appetite (e.g., inability to consume at least ~30 g of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food [RUTF]), or clinical signs such as persistent vomiting, fever ≥39°C, hypothermia <35°C, lethargy, severe dehydration, difficulty breathing, severe anemia, or infected skin lesions indicates Complicated SAM. Such cases require immediate inpatient care at a Nutrition Rehabilitation Center (NRC) or hospital. For example, if the aforementioned 18-month-old child has anorexia and fever, inpatient care is warranted. Uncomplicated SAM, where the child is alert, has no or mild edema (+), good appetite, and no major illness, can be managed as an outpatient with community-based therapeutic feeding programs. Weekly RUTF supply (e.g., ~2 packets/day for a 7 kg child, ~14 packets/week) and follow-up are essential. For MAM, inpatient care is generally unnecessary. Management includes nutrition counseling, supplementary feeding through community programs, treatment of minor illnesses, and monthly growth monitoring. For instance, a 3-year-old with a MUAC of 120 mm (12.0 cm) should receive calorie-dense food counseling, deworming, and regular weight checks. In inpatient SAM management, the WHO 10-step protocol is followed, including hypoglycemia correction, warmth maintenance, rehydration (oral preferred unless in shock), broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and gentamicin), therapeutic feeding (F-75 initially, transitioning to F-100 or RUTF), electrolyte correction, and micronutrient supplementation (excluding iron in the first week). Outpatient SAM care includes a single dose of amoxicillin, RUTF, deworming (albendazole if age >1 and not given in the last 6 months), and micronutrient supplementation (e.g., folic acid, vitamin A if due). Counseling on RUTF feeding, breastfeeding continuation, and hygiene is also crucial. Monitoring and adverse effects were not specified in the source.",

On examination, she appears pale and thin, with a BMI below the 5th percentile for her age. Her vitals reveal bradycardia (heart rate 48 bpm), hypotension (88/56 mmHg), and mild hypothermia (96.8°F). She denies bingeing or purging behaviors but admits to skipping meals regularly. A detailed dietary recall suggests an intake far below her caloric needs. She has missed her last two menstrual cycles, and her mood appears subdued. Laboratory tests show mild hypokalemia (serum potassium 3.2 mmol/L).",

On examination, she appears pale and thin, with a BMI below the 5th percentile for her age. Her vitals reveal a heart rate of 48 bpm and blood pressure of 88/58 mmHg. She denies bingeing or purging but admits to skipping meals and exercising excessively. A detailed dietary history shows minimal caloric intake over several weeks. Orthostatic vitals show a drop in systolic blood pressure of 15 mmHg upon standing. No fever or acute distress is noted. Laboratory testing reveals mild hypokalemia (serum potassium: 3.2 mmol/L).",

            "sequence_no": 17,
            "concept": "The time-phase diagnostic approach for nutritional deficiencies in paediatric patients, particularly in the context of acute versus chronic presentations, requires careful clinical evaluation, differentiation of key differentials, and appropriate diagnostic testing. Core clinical features of nutritional deficiencies often overlap with eating disorders (EDs) such as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED), which are prevalent in adolescents. Acute presentations may include dramatic weight loss, fatigue, dizziness, cold intolerance, and menstrual irregularities such as amenorrhea in girls due to low body fat. Chronic presentations may manifest as persistent gastrointestinal complaints, lanugo hair, acrocyanosis, edema, or cardiovascular abnormalities like bradycardia, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT intervals on ECG. Adolescents with EDs may not always appear underweight; those with atypical anorexia or bulimia may have normal or elevated BMI but still engage in harmful behaviors. Thus, single measures such as BMI or illness duration should not solely determine the need for treatment. Key differentials include other causes of weight loss or nutritional deficiencies, such as malabsorption syndromes, chronic illnesses, or endocrine disorders. High-risk groups include athletes in weight-sensitive sports, adolescents with a family history of EDs, extreme dieting behaviors, or comorbid conditions like Type 1 diabetes, where insulin manipulation (\"diabulimia\") may occur. Early recognition is critical, and screening tools such as the SCOFF questionnaire, with a threshold of ≥2 \"yes\" responses, can help identify potential EDs. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends evaluating adolescents with weight <5th percentile or an unexpected weight drop >10% for disordered eating. Definitive tests include a detailed dietary history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. CBC may reveal anemia or leukopenia, while electrolyte panels can detect hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis (vomiting), or acidosis (laxative abuse). Liver enzymes may be elevated due to starvation or bingeing, and thyroid function may show euthyroid sick syndrome in starvation states. Sampling pitfalls include overlooking subtle signs like Russell’s sign, parotid gland hypertrophy, or calluses on knuckles from induced vomiting. Interpretation dos and don’ts emphasize avoiding reliance on BMI alone and ensuring comprehensive evaluation even in adolescents with seemingly healthy weights. Hospital admission is warranted in cases of bradycardia (<50 bpm), hypotension (<90/60 mmHg), or significant electrolyte disturbances to safely initiate refeeding and prevent complications like cardiac arrest.",

            "sequence_no": 18,
            "concept": "Dietary counselling for vegetarian adolescents is essential to ensure adequate protein and micronutrient intake, particularly when food allergies or intolerances necessitate the elimination of staple foods. Adolescents with food allergies must strictly avoid confirmed allergens, such as cow’s milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish, which are often primary sources of protein, calcium, and vitamins. Eliminating these foods without proper substitutions can lead to deficiencies and growth faltering. For instance, cow’s milk protein allergy requires avoidance of dairy products, which are rich in calcium, vitamin D, and protein. Substitutions should include calcium- and vitamin D-fortified alternatives like fortified soy milk, almond milk, or calcium tablets, alongside calcium-rich foods such as leafy greens, sesame seeds, or ragi millet. Similarly, wheat allergy or celiac disease necessitates replacing wheat with gluten-free grains like rice, maize, millet, or fortified gluten-free breads and cereals to maintain adequate fiber and B-vitamin intake. When allergens such as eggs or legumes are eliminated, alternative protein sources like dairy (if tolerated), quinoa, or amino acid-based supplements should be incorporated. For vegetarian adolescents allergic to multiple nuts and legumes, guidance is needed to include safe protein-rich options and possibly multivitamin-mineral supplements to address common deficiencies, such as iron, zinc, vitamin D, and calcium. Monitoring growth and nutritional status is critical, as unmonitored elimination diets can become overly restrictive, increasing the risk of poor growth and micronutrient deficiencies. Individualized meal planning with a dietitian is recommended to balance allergen avoidance with caloric and nutrient needs, emphasizing a diverse diet within safe food options. Practical strategies include teaching adolescents to read food labels, identify allergenic ingredients, and manage cross-contact risks during food preparation. Education should also encourage healthy choices within their safe foods, such as opting for nutrient-dense alternatives rather than processed “safe” foods. In the Indian context, vegetarian adolescents with allergies may require culturally appropriate substitutes, such as finger millet or amaranth flour for wheat-allergic individuals, or hypoallergenic formulas and protein supplements if dietary intake is insufficient. Not specified in the source are sensitivity/specificity values, timing windows, or exact thresholds for supplementation.",

            "concept": "Managing treatment failure in adolescent malnutrition requires clear escalation protocols and referral criteria to ensure appropriate care. Admission and escalation criteria focus on vital signs, dehydration, neurological status, and bleeding. Hospital admission is recommended for adolescents with significant bradycardia (<50 bpm), hypotension (<90/60 mmHg), or electrolyte disturbances, as these can indicate severe malnutrition and associated risks such as cardiac arrest. Signs of dehydration, including orthostatic tachycardia or dizziness upon standing, are critical indicators of volume depletion, particularly in anorexia nervosa (AN). Neurological concerns, such as dizziness or fatigue, should also prompt escalation. Bleeding complications, though not specified in the source, should be assessed if clinically relevant. Initial laboratory evaluations are essential for identifying complications and guiding management. A complete blood count (CBC) may reveal anemia or leukopenia due to marrow suppression in AN. Electrolyte panels are crucial for detecting hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting), or metabolic acidosis (from laxative abuse). Liver enzymes may be elevated due to starvation or bingeing, and thyroid function tests often show a euthyroid sick syndrome in malnourished patients. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be performed to assess for prolonged QT intervals, bradycardia, or arrhythmias, all of which are common in severe malnutrition. Stabilization steps include careful nutritional rehabilitation and monitoring for refeeding syndrome, particularly in hospitalized patients. Refeeding must be initiated cautiously to avoid cardiac arrest or other complications. Adolescents with severe malnutrition presenting with bradycardia, hypotension, or electrolyte imbalances are candidates for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission to ensure close monitoring and stabilization. Discharge and review triggers are not explicitly specified in the source. However, ongoing outpatient management should focus on nutritional rehabilitation, medical stability, and addressing underlying eating disorders in collaboration with mental health professionals. Regular follow-up visits should assess weight trends, vital signs, and laboratory parameters to ensure recovery and prevent relapse.",

            "sequence_no": 20,
            "concept": "Specimen collection protocols for diagnosing nutritional deficiencies in paediatric patients require meticulous attention to ensure accurate results. Core clinical features of nutritional deficiencies often overlap with eating disorders (EDs) such as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED), which necessitate a high index of suspicion during evaluation. Adolescents with EDs may present with dramatic weight changes, fatigue, dizziness, cold intolerance, menstrual irregularities (e.g., amenorrhea in AN due to low body fat), or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical signs like lanugo hair, acrocyanosis, and edema in severe AN, or Russell’s sign and parotid hypertrophy in BN, may indicate nutritional deficiencies requiring further investigation. Key differentials include other causes of weight loss or malnutrition, such as chronic illnesses or metabolic disorders. Adolescents with comorbidities like Type 1 diabetes (e.g., diabulimia) or those in high-risk groups (e.g., athletes in weight-sensitive sports, those with a family history of EDs) warrant particular attention. Definitive testing involves a comprehensive medical evaluation, including dietary recall, exercise habits, and physical examination. Laboratory tests are essential to assess complications of nutritional deficiencies. A complete blood count (CBC) may reveal anemia or leukopenia due to marrow suppression in AN. Electrolyte panels can detect hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting), or metabolic acidosis (from laxative abuse). Liver enzyme elevations may result from starvation or bingeing, while thyroid function tests may show a euthyroid sick syndrome in starvation. Sensitivity and specificity values for these tests were not specified in the source. Sampling pitfalls include improper timing or handling of specimens, which can lead to inaccurate results. For instance, electrolyte levels may fluctuate based on recent vomiting or laxative use, and these behaviors should be documented to aid interpretation. Clinicians must avoid relying solely on single measures like BMI or illness duration to assess the severity of nutritional deficiencies, as even adolescents with normal or above-normal BMI may have significant deficiencies. Regular monitoring of weight, height, BMI, orthostatic vitals, and ECG (e.g., for bradycardia or prolonged QT) is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management.",

On examination, her BMI-for-age is below -3 SD, her mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measures 120 mm, and bilateral pitting edema is noted on her lower extremities. The healthcare worker decides to collect blood samples for hemoglobin levels, serum albumin, and micronutrient assessment, along with urine for protein analysis, ensuring adherence to proper specimen collection protocols. Anthropometric measurements are repeated to confirm accuracy. There is concern about underlying psychological factors contributing to her condition.",

            "concept": "Return-to-school advice for adolescents recovering from severe malnutrition or obesity-related complications requires careful consideration of early and late complications, red-flag warning signs, pathophysiology, bedside monitoring and escalation, definitive management, and follow-up. Early complications are not specified in the source. Late complications include rising obesity and associated health issues, exacerbated by sedentary behavior, as 81% of school-going adolescents aged 11–17 fail to meet the WHO-recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Red-flag warning signs are not specified in the source. The pathophysiology involves the role of physical activity in burning calories, building muscle to increase basal metabolism, improving insulin sensitivity, and enhancing psychological well-being, which can mitigate stress-eating. Bedside monitoring and escalation are not specified in the source. Definitive management involves motivational counseling tailored to the adolescent’s interests and baseline activity levels. Pediatricians should frame physical activity positively, emphasizing enjoyment rather than punishment or obligation. Activities can include sports like football, badminton, or basketball; dance; swimming; cycling; brisk walking; or active household chores. Counselors should clarify that structured exercise is not the only option, and creative alternatives like walking or cycling short distances, taking stairs instead of elevators, or dancing at home are equally beneficial. Adolescents can accumulate activity throughout the day, such as three 20-minute bursts, if continuous 60-minute sessions are challenging. WHO guidelines recommend at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily for 5–17-year-olds, with muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises (e.g., climbing, push-ups, jumping) on at least three days a week. Moderate activity is described as “when you can talk but not sing,” while vigorous activity is “when you can’t say more than a few words without pausing for breath.” Step-count goals, such as 10,000 steps per day, and technology integration through fitness apps, pedometers, or active video games can motivate adolescents. Follow-up involves ensuring adolescents understand the importance of physical activity and have opportunities to engage in it, supported by school sports and community programs. Pediatricians should counsel adolescents and their parents on integrating physical activity into daily life, emphasizing that any movement is better than none.",

He had been admitted with fatigue, recurrent infections, and growth faltering. During hospitalization, he was treated for severe anemia (Hb 6.4 g/dL) and started on nutritional rehabilitation. His mother reports improved energy levels but mentions he remains easily fatigued during physical activity and struggles to concentrate on schoolwork. On examination, his weight-for-age is at the 3rd percentile, and his height-for-age is at the 5th percentile. He appears pale, though his vitals are stable (HR 88 bpm, BP 100/60 mmHg). A repeat hemoglobin test shows improvement to 8.2 g/dL. The family seeks advice on when he can return to school and how to support his recovery while ensuring he does not relapse into malnutrition.",

He has resumed eating a balanced diet but occasionally skips meals due to lack of appetite. On examination, he appears thin but alert, with a BMI of 14 kg/m². Vital signs are stable, and there is mild pallor. His hemoglobin is 9.2 g/dL (mild anemia). His parents report that he avoids physical activity, citing tiredness, and has started withdrawing socially.

            "sequence_no": 24,
            "concept": "Addressing eating disorders in adolescents requires a structured approach encompassing screening, diagnosis, and referral protocols. Core clinical features of eating disorders include sudden weight loss, obsessive behaviors surrounding food, unhealthy weight control practices, and physical signs such as amenorrhea in female athletes. Early recognition of these features is critical to prevent progression to severe nutritional deficits or complications. Key differentials include other causes of weight loss, such as chronic illnesses, malabsorption syndromes, or psychological conditions like depression, which must be ruled out during evaluation. Definitive diagnostic tests for eating disorders are not specified in the source, but secondary prevention strategies emphasize screening tools and early detection measures. For instance, calculating body mass index (BMI) during routine health check-ups and using questionnaires to identify unhealthy weight control practices are essential components of screening. Sensitivity and specificity values for these tools are not provided in the source. Laboratory screenings for nutritional deficiencies, such as anemia or vitamin deficiencies, are recommended in high-risk populations. Additionally, monitoring growth parameters like BMI and height can identify early growth faltering or rapid weight changes, enabling timely intervention. Sampling pitfalls are not explicitly mentioned in the source, but it is essential to ensure accurate anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests to avoid misdiagnosis. Interpretation dos and don’ts include recognizing warning signs early, such as a shift in BMI percentiles (e.g., crossing from the 75th to the 90th percentile), and intervening promptly to prevent progression to obesity or other complications. In sports contexts, screening for relative energy deficiency signs, such as irregular periods in female athletes, is vital to prevent tertiary issues like stress fractures or amenorrhea. Referral protocols should be activated when adolescents exhibit significant clinical features or laboratory abnormalities, ensuring they receive specialized care to address both the eating disorder and its potential complications. In summary, addressing eating disorders in adolescents requires vigilance in screening, accurate diagnosis, and timely referral to prevent progression and mitigate long-term health impacts.",

            "sequence_no": 25,
            "concept": "Nutritional counselling for adolescents engaged in sports should focus on optimizing performance and recovery, integrating physical activity as a cornerstone of their lifestyle. Globally, including in India, 81% of school-going adolescents aged 11–17 fail to meet the WHO-recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily, contributing to rising obesity and related health issues. Pediatricians play a pivotal role in addressing this by promoting physical activity through motivational counselling and linking adolescents with structured programs like school sports or community initiatives. The emphasis should be on making physical activity enjoyable rather than a chore, identifying activities the adolescent enjoys, such as football, basketball, swimming, or even brisk walking with friends. For those not engaged in traditional sports, exploring interests like dance or active household chores can be a starting point. The goal remains achieving at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity daily, supplemented by muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises at least three times a week, as per WHO guidelines. When counselling, it is essential to clarify what constitutes moderate-to-vigorous activity. Moderate activity allows talking but not singing, while vigorous activity limits speech to a few words without pausing for breath. Practical examples include brisk walking, jogging, dancing energetically, or playing sports. Muscle-strengthening exercises need not require a gym; activities like squats, modified push-ups, yoga, or climbing are effective alternatives. Adolescents and their parents often mistakenly believe only structured exercise counts, which can be intimidating or inaccessible. Counsellors should dispel this myth by suggesting creative ways to incorporate activity, such as walking or cycling short distances, taking stairs instead of lifts, or dancing to music at home. Accumulating activity in shorter bursts, such as three 20-minute sessions throughout the day, is equally beneficial. Technology can be a motivating tool, with fitness apps, step-count goals (e.g., 10,000 steps/day), or active video games providing engaging options. Physical activity not only enhances performance by building muscle, improving basal metabolism, and increasing insulin sensitivity but also supports psychological well-being, reducing stress and preventing unhealthy eating patterns. Explaining these benefits in simple terms, such as “exercise helps your body burn food better and makes you stronger,” can resonate with adolescents, fostering long-term adherence to an active lifestyle.",

His diet primarily consists of rice, lentils, and occasional vegetables, with limited intake of milk, fruits, and protein-rich foods. He skips breakfast on most days and relies on packaged snacks post-practice. On examination, he appears lean with a BMI in the 10th percentile. He has mild pallor but no other significant findings. Vitals are stable. A hemoglobin test reveals a level of 10.5 g/dL.",

He is a state-level badminton player and has been training intensively for the past 6 months. Over the last 3 weeks, he reports feeling unusually fatigued during training sessions and struggles with muscle soreness that persists for several days. He also complains of occasional dizziness and poor concentration in school. On focused examination, he appears pale, with a BMI of 17.5 kg/m² (underweight for age) and mild tachycardia (heart rate: 105 bpm). His dietary history reveals irregular meals, frequent consumption of fried snacks, and limited intake of fruits and vegetables. A hemoglobin test shows 10.2 g/dL (mild anemia).",

            "sequence_no": 26,
            "concept": "The role of fortified foods in addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Indian adolescents is particularly significant for those with food allergies, as dietary restrictions can lead to nutritional gaps and growth faltering if not properly managed. Adolescents with allergies to common nutrient-rich foods such as cow’s milk, wheat, eggs, or nuts require careful substitution to ensure adequate intake of essential nutrients. For instance, cow’s milk protein allergy necessitates avoiding dairy products, which are primary sources of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. In such cases, calcium- and vitamin D-fortified substitutes like fortified soy milk, almond milk, or calcium tablets, along with calcium-rich foods such as leafy greens, ragi millet, and sesame seeds, are recommended to meet daily requirements. Similarly, adolescents allergic to wheat or those with celiac disease must rely on alternative grains like rice, maize, millet, or gluten-free fortified breads and cereals to compensate for the loss of B-vitamins and fiber. For each eliminated food, it is essential to identify safe alternatives or supplements that provide equivalent nutritional value. For example, adolescents allergic to eggs can obtain protein and micronutrients through legumes, meat, or nutritional supplements. In cases of multiple food allergies, daily multivitamin-mineral supplements may be advised to cover common deficiencies, particularly for vitamin D, calcium, iron, and zinc. Omega-3 supplements may be prescribed if fish allergies prevent the consumption of oily fish. Monitoring growth and nutritional status is critical, as unmonitored elimination diets can lead to poor growth and micronutrient deficiencies. Individualized meal planning with a dietitian is strongly recommended to balance allergen avoidance with caloric and nutrient needs. Culturally appropriate substitutes, such as finger millet or amaranth flour for wheat-allergic adolescents, are particularly important in the Indian context, where vegetarian diets are common. In addition to dietary management, education on reading ingredient labels, preventing accidental exposure, and making healthy choices within safe foods is vital. Adolescents must learn to identify allergenic ingredients, communicate dietary needs in social settings, and avoid cross-contact during food preparation. This comprehensive approach ensures nutritional adequacy and minimizes the risk of deficiencies in food-allergic Indian adolescents.",

            "concept": "Monitoring outcomes of nutrition programs in adolescents requires the use of specific indicators and evaluation methods tailored to this age group. Key indicators include dietary intake, physical activity levels, body composition, and eating behaviors, which must be assessed systematically to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. For undernourished adolescents, dietary counseling focuses on increasing calorie and protein intake through practical, affordable, and palatable modifications. For instance, a 14-year-old boy who is underweight may benefit from adding mid-morning and evening snacks, such as a peanut butter sandwich or nuts with a banana, alongside three main meals. Calorie-dense foods like ghee or oil in dals and rice, or milk powder and nut paste in porridge, are recommended. Protein intake should be emphasized at a minimum of 1 gram per kilogram of body weight per day; for example, a 40 kg underweight girl should aim for 40 grams of protein daily from sources such as pulses, legumes, eggs, milk, or meat/fish (if non-vegetarian). Small, frequent meals and adherence to routine eating schedules are also advised. For overweight adolescents, the focus shifts to healthy substitutions and moderation rather than restrictive diets, which can negatively impact growth. Practical strategies include reducing sugary drinks and high-fat foods, such as cutting down from two sugary colas daily to none or a maximum of one per week, and limiting fast food consumption from three times a week to once weekly. Teaching adolescents to read food labels for calorie, sugar, and fat content is empowering, and the concept of limiting “juncs” foods (junk food, ultra-processed items, caffeinated drinks, sugar-sweetened beverages) is emphasized. Physical activity is integral for both under- and overweight adolescents, with strength training recommended for undernourished teens to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, while aerobic and strength exercises are advised for overweight teens to improve fat loss and metabolic health. Sedentary time, such as recreational screen time, should be limited to less than two hours per day to encourage active pursuits and reduce mindless snacking. Addressing body image concerns is crucial, especially for adolescents influenced by unrealistic media portrayals. Promoting self-esteem and focusing on non-appearance-related strengths can help mitigate unhealthy behaviors like self-induced vomiting, laxative use, or starvation.",

He has been undergoing structured inpatient care for three weeks. Initially, his edema resolved within the first week, and his weight increased from 32 kg to 34 kg. However, over the past five days, he developed a low-grade fever (99.8–100.4°F) and his weight plateaued, with no further gain despite adequate dietary intake. Focused examination reveals mild pallor, no edema recurrence, and no signs of localized infection. Anthropometric measurements show his BMI-for-age remains at -2.5 SD. A complete blood count reveals mild anemia (Hb 9.8 g/dL), while other labs, including CRP, are within normal limits. The team is considering whether he is ready for discharge or requires further inpatient monitoring.",

            "concept": "Psychosocial support for adolescents with severe nutritional disorders, particularly food allergies, requires a multidisciplinary approach that prioritizes both dietary management and emotional well-being. The cornerstone of dietary management is strict elimination of confirmed food allergens, such as cow’s milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish, to prevent allergic reactions. However, this can pose significant nutritional risks, including deficiencies in protein, calcium, vitamin D, B-vitamins, and fiber, if appropriate substitutions are not made. For example, adolescents with cow’s milk protein allergy must avoid dairy products, which are major sources of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. To mitigate deficiencies, their diet should include calcium- and vitamin D-fortified substitutes like fortified soy milk, almond milk, or calcium tablets, as well as calcium-rich foods such as leafy greens, ragi millet, or sesame seeds. Similarly, wheat elimination due to wheat allergy or celiac disease necessitates alternative grains like rice, maize, millet, or gluten-free fortified breads/cereals to ensure adequate intake of B-vitamins and fiber. For each eliminated food, safe alternatives or supplements must be identified to maintain equivalent nutritional value, often with the aid of food substitution tables. In practice, individualized meal planning by a dietitian is essential to balance allergen avoidance with caloric and nutrient needs while promoting dietary diversity and enjoyment. Monitoring growth and nutritional status is critical, as unmonitored elimination diets can lead to poor growth and micronutrient deficiencies. Adolescents with multiple allergies may require specific supplementation, such as calcium/vitamin D for dairy avoidance, iron for limited meat or fortified grains, or omega-3 capsules for fish allergies. A daily multivitamin-mineral supplement is often recommended to cover common shortfalls like iron, zinc, and vitamin D. Education plays a key role in empowering adolescents to read food labels, avoid accidental exposure, and make healthy choices within their safe foods. For instance, a peanut-allergic teen can opt for other nuts or seeds if tolerated, rather than relying on processed \"safe\" foods. In culturally specific contexts, such as vegetarian diets in India, hypoallergenic formulas or protein supplements may be necessary to meet protein and calorie needs when staples like dairy or wheat are eliminated.

She has a history of multiple food allergies, including cow’s milk, wheat, and peanuts, and her diet has been restricted accordingly. Her mother reports difficulty in finding affordable and culturally acceptable substitutes for these foods, leading to frequent arguments at home about her eating habits. On examination, her BMI is 15.5 kg/m² (<3rd percentile), and she has pallor and mild angular cheilitis. A recent hemoglobin test revealed 9.2 g/dL. She appears withdrawn during the consultation, expressing frustration about feeling different from her peers and struggling with social isolation. The family has limited access to dietary counseling services and is unsure how to manage her nutritional needs while avoiding allergens.",

Her mother reports that the symptoms began after she was diagnosed with multiple food allergies, including cow’s milk, wheat, and peanuts, and placed on an elimination diet. The family struggles to afford safe alternatives, and the girl often skips meals due to limited options. She has become withdrawn, avoiding social gatherings where food is shared, and has expressed feelings of isolation. On examination, she is thin (BMI: 15.8 kg/m²), pale, and has dry hair and skin. Her vitals are stable, and her hemoglobin is 9.2 g/dL. She appears tearful during the interview and admits to feeling anxious about her dietary restrictions and their impact on her social life.",

            "sequence_no": 29,
            "concept": "Physical activity plays a pivotal role in adolescent weight management, complementing dietary measures and offering extensive health benefits. Counseling adolescents on physical activity requires a personalized approach that considers both the quantity and quality of exercise, alongside strategies to incorporate activity into their daily routines. Globally, including in India, physical inactivity is a significant concern, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that approximately 81% of school-going adolescents aged 11–17 fail to meet the recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. This sedentary behavior contributes to rising obesity rates and associated health issues. Pediatricians and healthcare providers must actively promote physical activity as a core lifestyle habit, employing motivational counseling techniques and leveraging programmatic initiatives, such as school sports or community programs, to ensure adolescents not only understand the importance of exercise but also have access to opportunities for physical activity. When counseling adolescents for weight management, discussions about physical activity should be framed positively, emphasizing enjoyment rather than framing exercise as a chore or punishment. Identifying activities the adolescent enjoys—such as sports (football, basketball, badminton), dance, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking with friends—is crucial. Counselors should assess the adolescent’s baseline activity levels and interests by asking questions like, “What do you like to do for fun?” or “Do you enjoy any sports or outdoor games?” Any movement is better than none, and even activities such as walking or biking to school, participating in physical education classes, or doing active household chores contribute to daily physical activity. The goal should align with WHO guidelines: at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily for 5–17-year-olds, with muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises included at least three days per week. Moderate activity involves a level where one can talk but not sing, while vigorous activity limits speech to a few words without pausing for breath. Examples of muscle-strengthening activities include squats, modified push-ups, yoga, or climbing. Counselors should address common barriers, such as misconceptions that only structured exercise (e.g., gym workouts) counts. Creative suggestions, such as walking or cycling short distances, taking stairs instead of elevators, or dancing at home, can help adolescents accumulate activity throughout the day. For those unable to do 60 minutes at once, breaking it into three 20-minute sessions is equally effective. Technology integration, such as fitness apps, step-count goals (e.g., 10,000 steps/day), or active video games, can further motivate adolescents. Physical activity aids weight management by burning calories, building muscle (which enhances basal metabolism), improving insulin sensitivity, and supporting psychological well-being, which can reduce stress-eating. Explaining these benefits in simple terms, such as “Exercise makes you fitter and stronger, and helps your body burn food better so it doesn’t turn into extra weight,” can resonate well with adolescents.",

Her mother reports a sedentary lifestyle, with the adolescent spending most of her time on schoolwork or her smartphone. The girl mentions feeling self-conscious about her weight and avoids participating in physical education classes at school. On examination, her BMI is at the 95th percentile for her age and sex. Vital signs reveal blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg and a resting heart rate of 84 bpm. When asked about her interests, she expresses a fondness for dancing but feels too embarrassed to join dance classes. Her school has limited sports facilities, and her neighborhood lacks safe spaces for outdoor activities. She has no history of significant medical issues, and her dietary habits include frequent consumption of packaged snacks and sugary beverages.",

            "sequence_no": 30,
            "concept": "Adolescent dietary choices are influenced by a complex interplay of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, particularly in the diverse Indian context. Socioeconomic status (SES) significantly impacts food availability, affordability, and dietary patterns. Adolescents from lower-income families often face limited access to nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, milk, and meats due to cost constraints, leading them to rely on cheaper staples like rice, roti, or calorie-dense foods such as fried snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages. This dietary pattern contributes to the dual burden of undernutrition, due to deficiencies in vitamins and minerals, and obesity, driven by the consumption of processed foods high in sugar and fat. For instance, a low-income rural adolescent girl may subsist on rice with salt and oil or watery dal, resulting in nutritional deficiencies, while an urban high-SES adolescent may overconsume fast foods and sugary drinks, leading to overweight or obesity. Notably, research highlights that overweight and obesity prevalence is higher among adolescents from wealthier families, likely due to lifestyle transitions, greater access to high-calorie foods, and cultural habits such as eating out or ordering food, which increase fat and salt intake. Conversely, food insecurity in low-SES households can lead to meal skipping or reliance on starchy staples, with occasional indulgence in energy-dense foods as a treat, creating a “feast and famine” cycle that paradoxically promotes fat deposition. Urban-rural disparities further compound dietary differences. Urban adolescents generally have greater exposure to convenience foods, advertisements, and obesogenic environments, including proximity to fast-food outlets and school canteens. Urban poor adolescents often rely on cheap street foods like pakoras, samosas, and sweetened drinks, while rural adolescents consume more traditional diets when available. Education levels also influence nutrition knowledge; adolescents from educated families may have better awareness of healthy eating, though knowledge does not always translate to action. For example, high-SES adolescents may understand the risks of soda consumption but still drink it daily due to peer influence and availability. Effective interventions must be tailored to SES contexts: improving access to affordable nutritious foods in low-SES settings through midday meals, supplementation, and food fortification, while moderating excess and reducing junk food appeal in high-SES settings. Psychosocial factors, such as family environment, also play a critical role, as adolescents typically consume what is available at home.",

            "sequence_no": 31,
            "concept": "Addressing nutrition-related complications in adolescents, including anemia, stunting, and metabolic syndrome, requires a structured approach to prevention and management. Early complications often stem from inadequate nutrition, leading to anemia, stunting, and early signs of metabolic dysregulation such as rapid weight gain or unhealthy eating behaviors. Late complications include severe anemia (Hb <7 g/dL), established stunting with long-term growth and cognitive impacts, and metabolic syndrome manifesting as obesity-related comorbidities like type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver disease, or cardiovascular risks. Red-flag warning signs include sudden weight loss, obsessive food-related behaviors indicative of eating disorders, rapid BMI changes (e.g., crossing from the 75th to 90th percentile), and symptoms of relative energy deficiency in athletes, such as amenorrhea or stress fractures. The pathophysiology underlying these complications varies. Anemia often results from iron deficiency, compounded by poor dietary intake or helminth infections. Stunting reflects chronic undernutrition during critical growth periods, while metabolic syndrome arises from excess calorie intake and sedentary lifestyles, leading to insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. Early detection and bedside monitoring are essential. Regular growth monitoring, including plotting BMI and height, can identify growth faltering or rapid weight gain. Screening programs, such as annual anemia camps for adolescent girls, laboratory tests for vitamin deficiencies in high-risk populations, and questionnaires to detect unhealthy weight control practices, are critical secondary prevention strategies. For athletes, monitoring menstrual regularity and energy balance can prevent progression to tertiary complications. Escalation of care depends on the severity of the condition. Adolescents with severe anemia (Hb <7 g/dL) may require hospitalization and transfusion, followed by iron supplementation and dietary counseling to prevent recurrence. Overweight teens with established type 2 diabetes or hypertension require medical management, such as metformin or antihypertensives, alongside structured diet and exercise plans to control obesity and prevent further complications like kidney damage or cardiovascular disease. Definitive management also includes life-skills training in schools, such as teaching gardening, cooking healthy recipes, and reading nutrition labels, to foster long-term healthy habits. Follow-up care involves ensuring adherence to dietary and medical interventions, regular monitoring of growth and metabolic parameters, and ongoing education to sustain preventive behaviors.",

            "concept": "Clinical management of adolescent undernutrition, particularly in the context of eating disorders (EDs) such as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED), requires clear criteria for admission, stabilization, and discharge. Admission and escalation criteria focus on vital signs, hydration status, neurological symptoms, and evidence of bleeding. Hospitalization is warranted for adolescents presenting with significant bradycardia (<50 bpm), hypotension (<90/60 mmHg), or electrolyte disturbances, as these may indicate severe malnutrition and associated risks such as cardiac arrest. Signs of dehydration, including orthostatic tachycardia or dizziness upon standing, further support the need for inpatient care. Neurological symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, or hypothermia, alongside physical findings like lanugo hair, acrocyanosis, and edema in AN, or Russell’s sign and parotid hypertrophy in BN, are critical indicators of severity. Bleeding-related concerns, such as anemia or leukopenia due to marrow suppression, should also be evaluated. Initial laboratory investigations include a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia or leukopenia, serum electrolytes to identify hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting), or acidosis (from laxative abuse), and liver enzymes, which may be elevated due to starvation or bingeing. Thyroid function tests often reveal euthyroid sick syndrome in malnourished adolescents. Electrocardiograms (ECG) should be performed to detect prolonged QT intervals, which are a concern in AN. Stabilization steps prioritize nutritional rehabilitation and medical stability. Refeeding must be carefully monitored to prevent refeeding syndrome, with attention to correcting electrolyte imbalances and addressing bradycardia or hypotension. Coordination with mental health professionals is essential for addressing the psychological aspects of EDs. Thresholds for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission are not explicitly stated in the source but may be inferred for cases with severe cardiovascular instability, profound electrolyte disturbances, or life-threatening complications. Discharge and review triggers are not specified in the source. However, ongoing outpatient care should include monitoring weight trends, nutritional intake, and mental health status, ensuring the adolescent achieves medical stability and engages in psychotherapy for long-term recovery.",

            "concept": "Monitoring nutritional status in adolescents involves implementing preventive strategies at three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Primary prevention aims to avert nutritional problems before they arise by promoting healthy behaviors and environments for all adolescents. This includes ensuring food security and access to a balanced diet, such as strengthening public distribution systems to provide sufficient grains and pulses to families with adolescents. Universal fortification of staples, such as iodized salt to prevent iodine deficiency and cognitive deficits, and iron-fortified rice in government feeding programs to reduce anemia, are key measures. Prophylactic deworming every six months in endemic regions prevents helminth-induced malnutrition. Health education campaigns, like \"eat right and play hard,\" encourage adolescents to adopt balanced diets and daily exercise to combat both undernutrition and overnutrition. Life-skills training in schools, such as teaching gardening, cooking healthy recipes, and reading nutrition labels, fosters long-term healthy habits. Secondary prevention focuses on early detection and prompt intervention to halt the progression of nutritional problems. Annual anemia screening camps for adolescent girls, followed by iron supplementation for those found anemic, prevent mild anemia from becoming severe and causing cognitive or growth impairments. Growth monitoring through BMI and height assessments in schools or pediatric clinics can identify early growth faltering or rapid weight gain, enabling timely counseling. For example, intervening when an adolescent's BMI crosses from the 75th to the 90th percentile can prevent obesity. Screening for eating disorders, such as recognizing warning signs like sudden weight loss or obsessive food-related behaviors, allows early referral and intervention. In sports, nutritional screening of student athletes, including checks for relative energy deficiency signs like irregular periods in female athletes, prevents progression to complications such as stress fractures or amenorrhea. Laboratory screenings for vitamin deficiencies in high-risk communities and questionnaires to identify unhealthy weight control practices also fall under secondary prevention. Tertiary prevention addresses established nutritional-related diseases to reduce their impact and prevent further complications. For adolescents with severe anemia (Hb <7), hospitalization and transfusion are required, followed by a plan to prevent recurrence. Overweight adolescents who develop type 2 diabetes or hypertension require medical management, such as metformin or antihypertensives, alongside dietary and exercise interventions to control obesity and prevent complications like kidney damage or heart disease.",

His parents report that he has been eating better since dietary counseling, but his appetite remains low, and he often skips breakfast due to early school timings. He complains of persistent fatigue and difficulty concentrating during classes. On examination, his BMI is 15.8 kg/m², and his weight has increased by only 1 kg since the last visit. A focused dietary recall reveals inconsistent intake of protein-rich foods and minimal calorie-dense snacks despite prior recommendations. His hemoglobin is 10.2 g/dL, slightly improved from 9.8 g/dL three months ago. The family expresses concerns about affordability of suggested nutritional interventions. The clinician discusses follow-up strategies tailored to his needs.",

She was identified six months ago as underweight during a routine health screening at her school, with a BMI below the 5th percentile for her age. At that time, she reported fatigue, difficulty concentrating in class, and skipping breakfast regularly. Her family’s diet primarily consists of rice and lentils, with minimal intake of fruits, vegetables, or protein-rich foods. She was counseled on incorporating calorie-dense and protein-rich foods, such as adding ghee to meals and including eggs or milk daily. At today’s visit, she reports improved energy levels but occasional missed meals due to household chores. On examination, her weight has increased by 1.5 kg over the last three months, though her BMI remains below the 10th percentile. Hemoglobin measured today is 10.2 g/dL (previously 9.5 g/dL).",

            "concept": "Adolescents with chronic illnesses or developmental delays require tailored nutritional management, particularly when recovering from severe malnutrition or undergoing nutritional rehabilitation. Discharge criteria for adolescents in this context aim to ensure sufficient recovery and the ability to sustain progress at home. Although most guidelines on severe acute malnutrition (SAM) focus on children under five years, similar principles apply to older children and adolescents, with adjustments for age-appropriate indices. Anthropometric recovery is a key discharge criterion, emphasizing the need for nutritional status to improve from the \"acute malnutrition\" range to a safe level. For adolescents, BMI-for-age percentiles or z-scores are used as proxies since weight-for-height charts are not standardized beyond puberty. Discharge is typically considered when BMI-for-age rises above –2 SD (approximately the 5th percentile for age and sex) and is sustained for at least two weeks. For example, a 14-year-old girl admitted with SAM at a BMI of 14 (–3 SD) might be ready for discharge once her BMI reaches approximately 16.5 (above –2 SD) and shows an upward trend. Percent weight gain from admission is another criterion, especially when baseline height or BMI references are unavailable. A commonly used target is a weight gain of ≥15% from admission weight; for instance, an adolescent admitted at 30 kg would need to reach at least 34.5 kg to meet this benchmark. Bilateral pitting edema, a sign of kwashiorkor, must resolve completely and remain absent for at least two weeks before discharge to confirm sustained recovery. In addition to anthropometric criteria, clinical and functional recovery is essential. Adolescents should be clinically stable, with any intercurrent illnesses resolved or controlled, and demonstrate a good appetite, consuming regular balanced meals without intensive medical support. Transitioning from tube or nasogastric feeding to oral intake is necessary, alongside nutritional counseling for the adolescent and their caregivers to ensure proper feeding practices at home. Psychosocial readiness, particularly in cases of eating disorders, should also be addressed. Ultimately, discharge decisions should ensure the adolescent is no longer severely malnourished, has no edema, and exhibits a consistent trend of weight gain, with the capacity to maintain nutritional progress independently.",

Her weight has increased from 32 kg to 35 kg (approximately 9% gain).

On examination, she appears alert, with no edema or signs of dehydration. Her mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is still borderline at 12.5 cm.

            "concept": "Adolescents with chronic illnesses who have undergone treatment for severe malnutrition or nutritional rehabilitation, whether in inpatient or structured outpatient settings, require clearly defined discharge criteria to ensure sustained recovery at home. Although most guidelines for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) focus on children under five years, similar principles apply to older children and adolescents. Discharge is appropriate only after nutritional status has improved beyond the \"acute malnutrition\" range, medical complications are stabilized, and the adolescent and their caregiver can maintain nutritional progress independently. Key discharge criteria include anthropometric recovery, resolution of clinical signs such as edema, the ability to consume an adequate diet, and a demonstrated period of continuous weight gain. For anthropometric recovery, adolescents are considered for discharge when they are no longer acutely malnourished by age-appropriate indices. Since weight-for-height charts are not standardized beyond puberty, BMI-for-age percentiles or z-scores are used as proxies. An adolescent who was severely thin (e.g., BMI-for-age < –3 SD) may be deemed nutritionally recovered when their BMI-for-age rises above –2 SD (approximately the 5th percentile for age and sex) and is sustained for at least two weeks. For example, a 14-year-old girl admitted with a BMI of 14 (–3 SD) could be discharged once her BMI reaches approximately 16.5 (above –2 SD) and shows an upward trend. Alternatively, percent weight gain from admission is sometimes used, particularly when baseline height or BMI references are unavailable. A commonly used target is a ≥15% weight gain from admission weight; for instance, an adolescent admitted at 30 kg would need to reach at least 34.5 kg. Additionally, bilateral pitting edema, if present, must completely resolve and remain absent for at least two weeks to confirm stability, as early edema resolution can falsely suggest rapid weight gain. Clinically, the adolescent should be well, with resolved or controlled intercurrent illnesses such as infections or diarrhea. They must demonstrate a good appetite and consume adequate nutrition without intensive medical support, transitioning from therapeutic or tube feeding to regular balanced meals. Nutritional counseling for the adolescent and their family is essential to ensure proper feeding practices at home. Not specified in source: psychosocial readiness criteria.",

Despite initial improvement, her BMI is currently 15.2 (–2.5 SD), and she has gained only 10% of her admission weight over 3 weeks. Her caregiver reports difficulty maintaining her nutritional plan due to financial constraints and irregular insulin availability. Examination reveals mild bilateral pedal edema and pallor, with no acute complications. Her fasting blood glucose is 240 mg/dL, and HbA1c is 10.5%. She has been on insulin therapy but with poor adherence. The family is concerned about her ability to sustain weight gain at home.",

He was admitted for hypoglycemia and recurrent infections, with a BMI of 14.5 (<-3 SD for his age/sex). During hospitalization, he was treated for severe malnutrition with therapeutic feeding and stabilization of his blood glucose levels. On follow-up, he reports fatigue and occasional dizziness but denies fever or recent infections. His appetite has improved, and he can now consume three meals daily. Focused examination reveals no edema, stable vitals (HR 88 bpm, BP 110/70 mmHg), and a weight gain of 2 kg since admission, bringing his current weight to 36 kg. His BMI is now 16.1 (-2 SD for age/sex). Labs show HbA1c of 8.2%, suggesting suboptimal glycemic control.

He was discharged two weeks ago after a three-month inpatient nutritional rehabilitation for severe acute malnutrition (BMI-for-age < -3 SD). At discharge, his BMI was 16.7 (just above -2 SD), with a documented upward trend. His caregiver reports that he has been eating better but struggles with fatigue and occasional nausea. Over the past week, he has lost his appetite and appears weaker. On examination, his weight is 1.5 kg lower than at discharge, BMI is now 16.0 (back to -2.5 SD), and mild pedal edema is noted. His vitals are stable, and he denies fever or abdominal pain. A review of his diet reveals insufficient protein intake due to financial constraints. Laboratory results from discharge showed normal electrolytes and albumin, but no recent labs are available.",

            "concept": "Adolescent-specific counselling techniques for adherence to physical activity in weight management require a tailored, motivational approach that aligns with the unique needs and preferences of this age group. Globally, including in India, 81% of school-going adolescents aged 11–17 fail to meet the WHO-recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily, contributing to rising obesity and related health issues. Pediatricians must actively promote physical activity as a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle, integrating it into adolescents' daily routines through enjoyable and sustainable methods. Counseling should emphasize the positive aspects of being active rather than framing it as a punishment or chore. Adolescents are more likely to adhere to physical activity when it aligns with their interests, such as sports (football, badminton, basketball), dance, swimming, cycling, or even brisk walking with friends. Counselors should begin by assessing the adolescent’s baseline activity levels and interests, asking questions like, “What do you like to do for fun? Do you have any sports or outdoor games you enjoy?”\n\nThe goal is to achieve at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily, as per WHO guidelines, with muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises included at least three days a week. Moderate activity is defined as being able to talk but not sing during it, while vigorous activity allows only a few words before pausing for breath. Examples of muscle-strengthening activities include squats, modified push-ups, yoga, or climbing. It is important to dispel the misconception that only structured exercise, like gym workouts, counts. Counselors can suggest creative alternatives, such as walking or cycling short distances, taking stairs instead of elevators, or dancing to music at home. For adolescents who find 60 continuous minutes challenging, breaking it into three 20-minute sessions throughout the day is acceptable. Step-count goals, like 10,000 steps daily, or fitness apps and active video games can also make physical activity more engaging and fun. Physical activity in weight management offers multiple benefits, including calorie burning, muscle building (which enhances basal metabolism), improved insulin sensitivity, and better psychological well-being, which can reduce stress-eating. Simplified explanations, such as “Exercise makes your body burn food better so it doesn’t turn into extra weight,” can help adolescents understand its importance and stay motivated.",

            "concept": "Monitoring and follow-up strategies tailored for individual and programmatic levels in paediatric weight management must incorporate a structured yet flexible approach to physical activity. Physical activity is a cornerstone of weight management in adolescents, complementing dietary measures and offering extensive health benefits. Globally, including in India, approximately 81% of school-going adolescents aged 11–17 fail to meet the WHO-recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. This inactivity contributes significantly to obesity and related health issues. Therefore, paediatricians should actively promote physical activity as a lifestyle habit through motivational counselling and by linking adolescents with programmatic initiatives such as school sports or community programs. Counselling should begin with assessing the adolescent’s baseline activity levels and interests. Many adolescents may not engage in structured exercise but might enjoy activities like sports, dancing, swimming, or cycling. It is crucial to frame physical activity positively, emphasizing enjoyment rather than presenting it as a chore. For example, asking questions like, “What do you like to do for fun?” or “Do you enjoy any outdoor games?” can help identify activities that resonate with the adolescent. Highlight that any movement is better than none, including walking or biking to school, participating in physical education classes, or doing active household chores. The goal should align with WHO guidelines: at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily for 5–17-year-olds, with muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises on at least three days a week. Moderate activity can be explained as “when you can talk but not sing,” while vigorous activity means “you can’t say more than a few words without pausing for breath.” Muscle-strengthening exercises can include squats, push-ups, or yoga, which do not require gym access. To overcome barriers, it is essential to dispel misconceptions that only structured exercise counts. Suggest creative alternatives, such as walking short distances instead of using transport, taking stairs instead of lifts, or dancing to music at home. For adolescents who find a continuous 60-minute session challenging, breaking it into three 20-minute bursts throughout the day is equally effective. Step-count goals (e.g., 10,000 steps daily) or fitness apps can also motivate adolescents, turning activity into a game or challenge. Active video games or technology-based fitness tools may further enhance engagement. By integrating these strategies, physical activity can aid weight management by burning calories, building muscle to improve basal metabolism, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and supporting psychological well-being, which can reduce stress-eating.",

She reports feeling tired during the day and avoids physical activities, preferring sedentary hobbies like watching TV. Her mother expresses concern about her recent weight gain over the past year, despite no changes in dietary intake. Focused examination reveals a weight of 62 kg (95th percentile), height of 150 cm, and BMI of 27.6 kg/m². Her vitals are stable, and there are no signs of acute complications. The school health program has implemented a structured physical activity initiative, but the adolescent has been non-compliant, citing lack of interest and peer pressure. Her baseline activity levels are minimal, with no participation in sports or walking to school. Her mother asks for advice to help her daughter engage in healthier habits.",
